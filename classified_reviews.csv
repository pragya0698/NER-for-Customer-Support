dept,rev
1,"i put them on at the doctor's office and the first time i had to take them off, sure enough, ran them. otherwise, liked them very much.
"
2,"this cord was advertised as fitting an lg2000 phone which it did not.
"
2,"do not buy my phone looks and works better with out cover
"
2,"the costume came fast and fit awesome. my only complaint was with the shoe coverings. they broke easily and would not stay on my daughters shoes so we ended up not using them.
"
3,"this device does well enough keeping the coffee warm, but i have black gunk along the bottom of every cup and mug that has sat on the warming pad, which seems to come off only with a long soaking in clr.
"
2,"as someone else commented, the ear buds tend to fall out once in a while as they're a bit big. 4-stars only because i bought these for $9 inc. shipping but not worth buying if you have to pay upwards of $20. buy an adapter instead and use ipod or sony buds.ps: haven't used them for making a call yet.
"
2,"this lunch box was actually too small and too flimsy to be used as such. my grandson puts disney miniature cars in it, instead. once he filled it up, the latch would barely stay closed in order to hold the contents. basically, it's a cheap piece of metal with disney cars painted on it to justify its price.
"
2,"i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since. it feels poorly constructed, the menus are difficult to navigate, and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them. my biggest complaint is that there appears to be no way to go from high volume to vibrate noiselessly (each push of the volume button makes a beep). i loved that feature on my startac. look elsewhere for a good flip phone.
"
2,"the jabra freespeak bt250 is not ready to be utilized in the business enviroment. i have used it for three months with the new sanyo multimedia 7400 phone, i found: a very short battery life, average reception, and a shorter roaming range from my phone {suppose to be able to move 30 feet away from your phone, i couldn't get it to work beyond 10 feet}. additionally, people would often tell me that they heard excessive noise in the background when a moderate wind is blowing.
"
1,"this shirt was labeled large, but it was more along the lines of xl to xxl. unfortunately after paying extra shipping charges, i had to pay more shipping charges to return. i won't buy from this supplier again unless they offer free return shipping.
"
2,"the battery did not work at all. it had a slight bubble hump on the pack. it was unfortunate because i needed it before a trip i was taking. however, i was able to get another one from the third party that sent it and then returned the bad one back a day before i had to leave.
"
2,"the nokia 900 mah nimn extended vibrating battery is anything but extended unless you are counting the time you will have it in a charger trying to keep it charged. i have had mine 41 days and am already having trouble keeping it charged. my phone is on about 10 hours per day with minimal talk time, usually less than 30 mins. per day.
"
2,"it advertises as 14"" and it is completely false. 14"" includes the clear plastic outside the frame!!!what a rip-off. do not think this is the real 14"" display for $200! it's more like a over-priced 7"" display. too bad it does not have 1/2-star on here!
"
1,"the shirt fits well, good style, good shirt. but bealls of florida sucks as a retailer. their customer service is rude, crude, and unrefined. even the supervisors of customer service suck, they don't return or accept any items back. so beware, you better be damn sure that size fits (ordered product before). because bealls of florida will not let you return the item for different size or style. i will not shop here again! i repeat, i will not shop here again. this place sucks as far as a retailer.
"
3,"i know it's called a beverage warmer, but it barely does that. i wouldn't recommend this at all. i had a cup warmer by dazey (can't find it now) and it kept my drink hot, as it should. i mean who wants a warm beverage, which this warmer barely does.
"
2,"i am not at all happy with the case. it has not been designed to make sure that the phone does not fall off. it can slip easily when you sit.
"
2,"the replacement battery arrived on time but it did not fit easily into my motorola v557 phone like the original battery does. when i got it in, put the back on the phone, and connected the charger, the phone indicated that it could not charge the battery. i contacted bargaincell and they offered a refund if i return the battery prepaid. this seems reasonable except that the packaging and shipping cost about as much as the battery (only $1 less). i don't mind paying it once to get the battery but i'm not about to pay it again to return the battery.
"
1,"i purchased an under armour compression tee at a local store in a size large. the shirt fit fantastic. i wanted a back up so i purchased this one online size large, different color. the shirt arrives on time, open the package and it is a large but does not even fit over my shoulders.... i contacted the vendor for an exchange. they do not do exchanges but will allow me to return the shirt. if the shirt was worn it has to be washed before returning it... no problem for i could not get the shirt on anyway so tags etc were all in place. if you pass 30 days, there is a restocking fee of 20% which i was unaware of.when i questioned the vendor why i have a large and ordered the same size it did not fit. the vendor stated that under armour has different sizing charts for different shirts. that just did not make sense. how are you to buy a product with ""floating"" sizes.so, i went online to nordstrum to find the same exact heat guard compression tee. there was a size chart that could be pulled up to check size before ordering.... only 1 chart for under armour. i did all the measurements correctly to find that i was to order a large.i know the shirt fits tight but since i already had a large that fits, and the chart from under armor at nordstrum confirmed that i had ordered the correct shirt size, the statement that there are different size charts for different under armour shirts "" just doesn't fit!"".i personally will visit a store and actually try it on to avoid the hassle and disappointment of waiting for a product that does not fit, seemingly was ordered correctly, and then had to be mailed back.
"
2,"this phone is very pretty, but it has many flaws- it crashes repeatedly, even during phone calls...it smudges quite easily and is very prone to scratching(so make sure to buy a case too)the reception is allright(sometimes there's an echo)-i use t-mobile, and if you look at the manual-you should get used to this phone in time. bottom line: not nearly as great as it seems-
"
3,"we had to buy a new lunchbox for our son after 2 months (a different brand, machine-washable) because this one is way too hard to clean. i have turned it completely inside out, scrubbed between all the cracks, and still food is stuck in the seams andthreads. it is very durable, but we can't get rid of the smell or stains with a reasonable amount of effort.
"
1,"this shirt is absolutely the worst in the market. the fabric is cheap, so cheap, that i threw the darn thing away
"
2,"push buttons on the rim are exposed and active even when the cover is closed. they cannot be disabled. these buttons control ring profiles so that the phone will change to silent without warning.
"
2,"this case is not worth the money. the first problem was with the screw that hold the belt clip would not stay in the case. i glued that in place. then the clip would not hold onto the case. then the belt clip broke. the last thing was that slide that holds the palm in the case broke. i would not recommend this case to anyone and would like to warn anyone that might want to try it. look elsewhere!!!
"
2,"i purchased the pulsar 590a 2 months ago. it is a terrific product. the sound is great. i purchased it to simultaneously connect to my ipod and blackberry pearl phone while walking. again, i could not be more satisfied.in addition, plantronics support is amazing. i asked them for the cost to just replace the adapter. i thought i broke it. they said it should be almost impossible to break with normal use. i got another pulsar 590a headset and adapter without cost to me in less than a week.the unit is small and folds into a nice looking case. the light is no big deal. very nice looking headphones. i do not understand anyone negatively reviewing this product.
"
2,"let me start off by saying that this is my 4th cell phone in 5 years, and this by far is the best phone i've ever owned. phone is so ergonimically correct, and its touch wheel (similiar to that of the ipod) and buttons surrounding the wheel (also touch sensitive) work flawlessly and are amazing. you can set different sensitivity levels for the touch bad and buttons which is awesome. the feature that i enjoy most about this phone is the bluetooth. i purchased a platronics voyager 510 (works flawlessly up to its advertised 30ft range) along with the phone and the two pieces of hardware are a match made in heaven. you can add a multitude of contact information to each phone number saved in your phone (email, fax, home, cell, work, picture, custom ringer -phone call, custom ringer -txt msg, place contacts into a group) and the screen display is top notch as well.some cons, the buttons along the side of the phone are a bit hard to press as they are indented into the phone as to prevent them from being pressed by mistake. would of been nice of lg had put some single, double, triple tick marks on the buttons so that you could at least become familiar with the feel and function of the button. the latch for the charger and for the usb hookup seem a bit flimsy and i believe will ultimately break prematurely.last thing, i didn't know that vcast only worked in certain areas. if you're not in verizons ed-vo area of coverage then you cannot use the feature. i'm in santa barbara and i get no coverage, checked for other local cities...ventura, santa maria, thousand oaks and they are not covered either. however, pasadena and los angeles are covered...not sure if that helps anyone but thought i'd through it out their.
"
2,"it's cheap, eforcity delivers quickly, however, may not actually be oem. all of the oem chargers i've seen (model number syn0847) has glowing stylized ""m"" motorola logo. this item, however, does not; it only has a small blue led underneath the ""m"" that glows when it's plugged in. all of the other labeling on the charger looks authentic motorola. maybe a really good knockoff? anyway, does the job just fine (see title), and, again, it beats paying $20 at cingular.
"
2,"kyocera make the worst phone in the world. don't touch it, otherwise i am sure you will regret as i did. i really admire those kyocera people who can make phones so bad.
"
2,"don't buy this phone ever. i had it for just over six months and now it's having problems from last 3 months... drop calls whenever it wants..:) now, popping up orange pixels on screen and seems like dead or burnt pixels and it's growing day by day.. i called t-mobile customer service and they are sending the replacement because it is under warranty.. what if it wasn't? do the math.. they also charged me shipping for sending replacement. ridiculous, isn't it????i am rating it 1 because that is the lowest score you can select here.. it's &lt; -infinity
"
2,"some quick commentsfirst dont get the verizon car charger. mine had a tag on the cord which indicated that it must be disconnected after the phone is charged. maybe to prevent battery overcharging? useless for me on long trips! verizon charger was over $30.00. at staples a motorola charge which can be left connected was less than $16.00.i use a palm pilot alot and can dial via bluetooth phone numbers on other cell phones. this does not work on v3m. also simple sending of contact information did not work. a quick look for software to connect v3m to outlook or the palm for daily schedules resulted in nothing. to connect the v3m to pc via usb appears to require a $30.00 package from verizon.the v3m does not have a standard wired hands free connector on the phone. i did get a ""converter"" which i have not tested but even if it does the phone does not support both the charger and wired hands free at the same time. the converter may only be for headphones but even if it works with headphones it another thing to carry around or lose.voice dialing does work great and speaker phone is good.
"
2,"these work to charge your phone, but the casing around part that plugs into the phone is slightly wide, causing the plug to fall out of the phone easily. this is especially aggravating with the car charger. i think it's worth the money to get the better fitting items from samsung.also - why does samsung change the plug in each phone model? the blackjack 1 and blackjack 2 do not use interchangeable plugs and my wife's samsung flipphone uses a completely different connection. are they trying to make money on peripherals and chargers?
"
1,"great fabric and tight fit. problem is that if you are over 6ft tall, then all under armour products will be too short in the torso. this company does not listen to the customer.
"
1,"thought the product worked great... only problem had was first time was too small...second was that not happy with cost to ship...way overpriced
"
1,"great fabric and tight fit. problem is that if you are over 6ft tall, then all under armour products will be too short in the torso. this company does not listen to the customer.
"
1,"i bought a pair in maroon and they were a little short but fine. the problem was that they started coming apart at the seams after 2 months. will definitely be looking to a different company for a replacement pair.
"
2,"this thing is a game changer!! my stomach looks like it did in high school/ long before 3 csections when i wear it!!! i just wish i had bought it right after childbirth!! i don't know where it's pushing my fat to, and i don't really care!!!
"
1,"i have bought dockers for years but these are cut smaller than they usually are. even with the ""stretch"" waist band they are tight. so much for an ""extra"" inch. beware. try these in a store before you buy.
"
2,"i initially purchased this phone through verizon: a brand new razr. it looked nice, but the battery on the phone was worthless. every night i had to recharge the phone. even when i did not use the phone all day, i still had to charge the phone at night. same thing happened after exchanging the battery. i tried three different batteries, but same result. maybe i had a defective phone, but that did not matter to me. i simply exchanged the phone after seven days to another model. i would not get this phone if i were you. hope this helped.
"
2,"i'm in the middle of my pregnancy, so i really need a car charger!amazon's description said this model was compatible with my nokia6102 flip cell phone, but it isn't it has the standard regular size tip for charging, which would work with most nokia cell phones prior to the nokia 6102 flip phone! the nokia 6102 flip cell phone has a new smaller charger end, so with all due respect might i suggest that someone grab a nokia 6102 flip cell phone, and the above car charger to see that they are ""not"" compatible, to help prevent this in the future! because i am still pregnant and i still need a car charger, for my nokia 6102 cell phone!i due honestly appreciate the fact that amazon at least paid for the return shipping, since the charger wasn't compatible!
"
1,"shirts of average quality...worth about what i paid for them, $10.00.....built in collar stays...
"
2,"this bluetooth lets in a lot of outside noise. if there is anything going on in the background, the other person is going to hear it. tv's or radio's, road noise. almost anything. i would suggest a different unit.
"
2,"i wrote a review before, it was great. how things change the ear piece fell apart and now the headset is useless. i adjusted the rating downward. beware.*****original review follows******this model is far superior to the ericsson hand-free model. i used the ericsson hands-free and i was always straining to hear. with the body glove model i have no problem hearing or others hearing me.also the ericsson model has nothing to hold the earpiece you must shove it down your ear canal. not good hygiene.must have especially now as it is illegal to drive with a cellular phone in hand in ny
"
2,"the phone itself is pretty good, feels comfy in the hand and the bottons protrude and ""click"" so it gives nice tactile feedback, something missing from almost every phone on the markey. so you know what you're pressing at all times, almost no texting errors.however, two flaws, and one of them is major.1. how can a phone not have an input for an earbud? this is absolutely unacceptable, and i've never seen a phone in the last 6-7 years not have a simple ear bud jack, ridiculous! this is the sole reason i returned mine, as i do not care for bluetooth, i prefer simple corded earbuds as they are cheap to replace if lost.2. another pretty serious flaw is the battery. it is rated at 3 hours, but that is pushing it.overall this could have been a great phone, but two pretty stupid, unthinkable mistakes like not including a basic earbud jack ruins it.
"
2,"i am not satisfied with my phone bec i can't maximize the features and i cant open my web. i tried to use the cd that comes with it but the serial number on the phone doesnt match. its not registered yet bec of this serial #. the silicon case i received is wrong, you sent me the one for 650, my unit is 600. i'l apreciate if you send me the right one. thank you.
"
2,"this product alone does none of the things listed in the descrption by itself. you must still buy other software to use it. when i questioned them about why they listed it as doing all these things, which it doesn't do, they pointed out where it says ""may require 3rd party software for various uses"". i just didn't know that the definition of 'various' was all uses we have listed.i would rate my experience with this seller as: dissapointingat least let my misfortune be a warning to someone out there somewhere.
"
1,"i bought 6 of these shirts going by the photographs and some of the reviews. dont mean to be rude, but people who gave these shirts probably haven't wore a decent dress shirt. you can frequently get 'good' $45 shirt for $10 in malls when on sale. i thought this was a better deal. but boy oh boy, i can assure you this is not much better than what you might get at a dollar store. i had ordered these as a gift, but now will give them to red cross because these should not be worn at any kind of formal occassion, or even for daily use (except maybe when you are working at septic tanks or something). these are from bangladesh, and i can assure you, they are not much better than what would be sold for $0.50 in bgd. if you have any self-respect and work in anything but a lowest income group atmosphere, do not buy these shirts.
"
3,"pros: it does what it's supposed to - keeps drinks warm.cons: the warming surface is a little small, doesn't fit wider mugs. mine stopped working after a month, and i'm not sure why. it may not be spill proof, because i got some coffee on top... perhaps it shorted somehow?bottom line: ok, but might be a better one out there...
"
2,"i do not recommend this phone!!! the alarm sucks, its impossible to get service anywhere!!but what sucks most of all is that the buttons fall of and of course warranty does not cover this..part of the reason i purchased this phone was due to how sexy and streamlined i thought it looked compared to other phones at the time of purchase..but now that the buttons feel off, im stuck with a phone that looks like a like crap and functions horribly. do not invest money in this phone..
"
1,"i wore this shirt just once. it's almost transparent. not worth it even if you get it for free.
"
2,"this headset has a major flaw - the connections between the headset and phone are full of static. the other parties don't hear it, but their voice is constantly zapped by the static, and i'm asking them to repeat themselves. i've compared it with a couple other headsets i've got, and they don't have this problem in the same locations. actually, this headset has static problems anywhere - office, car, out walking, you name it.do yourself a favor and avoid this one.
"
1,"i put them on at the doctor's office and the first time i had to take them off, sure enough, ran them. otherwise, liked them very much.
"
2,"even though this is rated to hold up to 2000 lbs. i would not trust it to last very long. the nylon and ropes that this comes with are clearly very low quality. some of the ropes even showed signs of fraying straight out of box. cannot recommend this item.
"
1,"paid around 10 bucks for the shirt, but its not wort 10 bucks at all, cant wear to office cos the cloth is see thru. very thin cloth.
"
2,"i use my phone a lot and i have purchased an average of 1 standard phone battery per year because i talk them dead or forget to plug the phone in to charge the battery. this battery is awesome, i have found that thus far i cannot talk it dead and if i forget to plug in my phone the battery still has a charge.
"
2,"this story tops them all. i have dropped my palm tx over and over with the palm tx case. it's kind of banged up. the belt clip is kind of worn out. the springing thing won't hold it very well any more. the other day i got home from work and it was almost dark so i had to hurry and do some snowblowing. i heard a bump sound and didn't realize my palm fell off the belt clip. i ran over it with my snowblower and it came out the shoot and hit the wall. i didn't realize it until i dug it out of the snow two days later. the tx was gaping open and the stylus was broken in half. i snapped it closed and the tx still works fine! just had to get a new stylus. weird, because my first tx died on me with no bumping around and i got this replacement one under warranty.
"
2,"the bra is too &#34;molded&#34; for my taste. the cups are very thick and feel to the breast the way a helmet feels to a head. it does have a good basic design but i will be returning it because of the uncomfortable density of the cups.
"
1,"i have worn jobst compression hose for a few years now. i havenever had a problem. i was thrilled when i had the option fora sheer pair....great for summer. the third time i wore one pair,i got a hole in them. i am not even sure how that happened. i figuredi must have done something. i put on my backup pair and the first timei wore them i developed a hole in them...the same leg (right one). nowthat i see these posts i know i will never purchase them again.
"
2,"i had a jabra earset for my old nokia 5160 and it worked beautifully! i upgraded my phone to the 8260 and purchased the &quot;compatible&quot; jabra. the phone recognized that a headset was connected, but i could only hear extremely faint sound coming from the earpiece (yes, the volume was turned up all the way). went back to the store to try more of the same jabra units with no luck. i'm stuck with the nokia factory headset which sounds fine, but nobody can hear me talk...
"
2,"yep. motorola knows how to make an automobile power cord. has a convenient on off light that you'll never miss. it's big and bright.
"
2,"does not cut down on ambient noise, and makes my voice smaller on the phone. i found it clumsy to try and find earpiece and manage the wire. i think it would be better to have one of those boom-type microphones that gets closer to my mouth.
"
3,"this steamer set is not worth the price. i read the negative reviews and assumed people were just picky, but that is not the case. i have used this steamer 2-3 times per day since it arrived. the quality is very low; metal is thin and feels cheaply made. the lid cracks and pops as it heats up and cools down. the steamer is not small, but isn't as big as it looks in the picture. when i am steaming something, if i put the stove on high, water spits out from around the lid making a huge mess. i have to put the stove on medium-high, and set the lid on the edge to prevent it from spitting, which increases the cook time.if i could do it again, i would not purchase this item. i anticipate i will need to buy another steamer in 6 months or so and will spend a little more to get a better quality item.update 1/2013: i did get rid of this. after getting, as a wedding gift, a complete new set of pans, we bought another ""norpro 175 stainless steel vegetable steamer"" which fits inside your existing pans. nine dollars, and well worth it.
"
2,"very loose fit on the ear and hard to reconnect if you go out of range
"
2,"i bought the jabra earset for my nokia 5190 about a month ago. a friend of mine also bought the same earset and i was able to hear them talking on theirs (using nokia 6190). the receiver sound quality (talking) is slightly worse than a normal cellphone. it sounds somewhat distant and echoey. also, it picks up background noise, especially from a car and almost seems to amplify the noise, making it hard for people to hear you. the speaker (listening) for the user is very clear and i had no problems finding an earpiece adapter that fit me.problem: the biggest problem i've noted with these earsets is an annoying background &quot;buzz&quot;. i have been told that this is caused by the earpiece wire picking up reception from the cellphone antenna. this buzz can be heard both on your side and the person you are talking to can hear it as well, creating quite an annoyance. in fact, this background buzz is so bad at times that i have stopped using my jabra earset entirely unless i am driving (it is law in california). the only way to get rid of the buzz is to orient the wire in certain positions or hold the wire in certain places (very impractical, especially if you are moving around). i would return this item and buy something else except that i bought it using an amazon discount certificate, so i can't. i've been told that not all earsets have this problem so it is probably advisable that you if you get this you are able to return it or try it out first.
"
2,"the bag is unusable in the vacuum for which it is marketed. according to the written description and picture, this bag is made for this vacuum. it does not fit the attachment inside the vacuum and is completely unusable. it is a total waste of money.
"
3,"why do i keep forgetting about these type of ""sales""???thanks to all of the wonderful people - reviewers - who truly care about others.i'll pass on these.
"
3,"as other reviewers have stated, these curtain rods will not sustain much weight at all. they really aren't spring rods - you just twist it into place.i ordered 3 and they were so poorly packed that two of them were bent and completely unusable.i wouldn't bother with these, or buy them from country curtains because you can get an anchor so that they can hold more weight and be more stable. of course, their $30 each instead of $19!!!!
"
1,"this bra is completley worthless! it offers absolutely no support, is cheaply made and does not run according to size. don't waste a penny on this. you will be disappointed.
"
2,"this phone is horrible. i live in the middle of a big city and i dont get reception in my own house. people sound gargled and like their in a tunnel. the mirror on the front get scratched way to easily. i think the only thing cingular was thinking of when the made this phone was the size. it is the worst phone i have ever owned. dont buy it. its a waste of money. find a better phone that might be bigger, but at least u will be able to talk on it. :( i wish i could give it lower than a 1 as a rating. i would give it a -5.
"
2,"the headset is cheap. the kind you will find at a dollar store. the cell carrying case is also cheap and too tight, i could not use it. basically you are getting a car charger.
"
2,"i had this headset for 3 days. dropped it from waist level and now it doesn't work. i could have gotten better use out of $30 by purchasing a fairly decent bottle of wine...it would be gone too, but i would have had more enjoyment out of it. this unit is very small, and getting it into the ear is awkward, and is impossible to do without pressing one of the volume up/down buttons, which means you will have to re-adjust. if you have larger hands, like i do, it is a little odd to handle...hence, the greater possibility of it being dropped. the sound was mediocre at best, and everyone i spoke to (in the short 3 days that it did work) said there was an echo on their end. not recommended. move on to another.
"
2,"i could never get this to work correctly with either of my windows vista computers. i ended up getting a copy of 5.0 from some where else and it worked fine. couldn't up grade w/ this software to the new version, so a total waste of money.
"
1,"i have had these for a little over a year now. the edges are starting to chip off, and they have been stained a little. they are ok, but not wonderful. i feel like for a kitchen aid product, they should be much better.
"
2,"the product was very difficult to put on that i just gave up on it. couldn't return it because the orginal wrapping had been thrown away.
"
2,"i purchased this item to wear postpartum. i love how it fits and how well it smooths things out post baby. the major downside to this is the poor quality. the eye portion of about five of the hook/eye closures has come out entirely. i know that this is not a sizing issue because i followed the sizing for the product and it's only select ones that appear to not have been sewn as well as the rest. very disappointing for what would have otherwise been an awesome product that i could recommend to others, to instead be a waste of my money!
"
2,"i just got the newest version of the palm tx--and i'm not sure if they've changed the dimensions or anything--but this case does not close when i put my palm tx in it. that's right, it doesn't work with the new tx. there is a small piece of plastic that is supposed to keep the palm in the case, but this is preventing the case from closing because the palm is too large.fyi. i will probably keep the product and just break off the little piece of plastic. but just so you know, don't buy this hardcase if you're getting a new palm tx (with wi-fi and such).
"
1,"having read the previous reviewers' reports warning about how easily this product could develop runs, i was super careful and tried very much to make my expensive pair last. the first time i had this pantyhose on, i got a bad run that ruined this very expensive pair of hosiery! unbelievable!
"
2,"it appears that there are fans of roomba products however, irobot definitely got ahead of itself with the introduction of this model. the scheduler is a great feature although programming it is rather clumsy in its design. the intelli-bin feature does not live up to its name. it does not work. either irobot did not test it fully before release or it is plagued by manufacturing defects. to make matters worse, irobot's customer service is inexcusable. after several emails and lengthy waits on hold, i have yet to get a replacement or any kind of resolution. i'm given a different answer each time i contact them and i never hear back from them when promised. my advice is save your money and avoid the frustration. if you're still convinced you want one, wait until irobot fixes this model and gets its act together.
"
2,"this item arrived promptly and in good condition. my teenage son assembled it in a couple of hours before i arrived home from work, so i gather that it went together easily enough. the cart, being real wood, looks quite nice, but the legs, top, etc. are pieced together from multiple pieces of wood, which raises some questions in my mind about strength and long-term durability. if only it had lasted that long...after using the unit for less than a week, one of the casters disintegrated without warning (massive structural failure of the plastic housing) as i was pointing the cart in a different direction. we had a 27"" crt-based tv plus a dvd and vcr on the cart at the time, and luckily none of them fell off as the cart tipped sharply when the caster collapsed. altogether it was about 100 lbs. of gear, but the cart is large enough that it should be designed to accommodate a significantly larger tv than the one we had on it.comparing the casters on this cart with those on a smaller tv cart that we were replacing, i discovered that these were smaller and of lighter construction -- clearly undersized for this cart, which is a design flaw rather than a manufacturing problem. i drilled out the holes in the legs to accommodate the larger casters from the old cart (which we had used for a couple of years with the same tv/vcr/dvd setup), so i'm hopeful that if the legs themselves don't give way, we'll be able to get some use out of this unit after all.to summarize, i would recommend this unit only for light duty use with small tv's.

1,"it's definitely not having the cutting as shown on the model. i ordered size m as that's suggested on the the manufacturer's site for size 6. it's way too big. i exchanged it for size s. i have 36"" breast and 26"" waist and it's still way too big.the cutting is very bad as well. it's just a giant piece of flat cloth and they didn't have the shape for cups. thus once you tie up at the back, you will have a weird surplus of fabric underneath your boobs. very ill fitting.
"
2,"did not work at all. don't buy. i returned and got a discount. would not work with any station. junk
"
2,"my advice. purchase the cable and download the free software over the internet. like other reviewers i never got this software provided to work.
"
1,"this is the first time i've had anything negative to say about under armour,and my complain is not really about the product, but the company, as the 2 shirts i ordered was to be short sleeved, and they arrived as sleeveless,it was a birthday gift to my grandson, and he assured me it was ok. i went along with him, but when i received this letter asking if i would rate the transaction, i had to tell you.i will think twice before i order again, this was a plain and simple order, and you messed it up.if i had had time i would have returned them for the right kind, but they were delivered on the birthday so i gave the package to him as it arrived,ibg1105
"
1,"having read the previous reviewers' reports warning about how easily this product could develop runs, i was super careful and tried very much to make my expensive pair last. the first time i had this pantyhose on, i got a bad run that ruined this very expensive pair of hosiery! unbelievable!
"
2,"the battery worked fine, for a while. but within a month of purchase the connection plate quite literally split off from the battery and rendered it useless. granted i use two batteries (to allow complete discharge/recharge cycling) so they're pulled in and out of my phone often, but the original battery is still going strong and this one fell apart.truth be told i probably got my money's worth out of this battery and you probably will to, but don't expect that $5 to get you very far.
"
3,"i bought these at target too. yes, they are very big and take up a big space in the cupboard. the handles are terrible because there isn't really a handle on them. yes, the rubber footing keeps them in place- when you can keep the rubber gasket to stay on. but if you want to hang on to the bowl like to mix up a pie crust, i have other bowls with a great big handle that's so much easier to grab and hand on to while working the dough. and if you want to use a hand mixer with 2 beaters in these bowls, forget it, they're too curved at the bottom. my other set of mixing bowls have a flatter bottom so i can use the hand mixer. there's just too much wrong with these bowls to get much use out of them.
"
2,"the battery came and it was obviously not a new battery as advertised. if i paid more than a few bucks - i would send it back.
"
2,"the biggest downside to this keyboard isn't really the fault of the manufacturer; apple will not allow external keyboards to use auto-capitalize and auto-correction features. beyond that, however, there is only one shift key on the left side of the keyboard, making it impossible to capitalize half of the letters easily. also, the keyboard jiggles a bit when it slides back under the phone. i have tried to begin the process of returning mine, but customer service has not responded to my request nearly one week after i made it. bottom line: if you want a physical keyboard, you probably shouldn't have an iphone in the first place.
"
2,"i bought 5 different brands since i had my second baby 4 months ago, and i am finally happy! great product. does what it needs to do! will buy more.
"
3,"big waste of money! after washing noticed 1 pillow case was a different shade and so wrinkled no matter what i've tried. stuck with it since i washed and can't find packaging.
"
2,"i loved the idea of having all my shoes on a tree that i could spin around, but the end result was messy. it was weird having the soles of my shoes facing outwards. wherever i put the tree seemed like a dirty place. i replaced the tree with drop-front clear plastic shoe boxes that i love.
"
2,"this tip should be labeled differently. it is actually a mini-usb tip for the kensington charger. while it actually is for the blackberry it works for anything that uses a mini-usb. i wish they would have called it ""mini-usb tip"" to avoid the confusion i had prior to buying the thing. the price is crazy too. kinda pricey for just one tip but if you have the charger you know that the thing is getting harder to find. i use it to charge all of my mini-usb stuff and haven't had any problems.
"
3,"i was so dissapointed when i receive this saucepot. so smaller. i do not know what i can do with this steamer. you can only steam one egg each time. it does not worth this price.moreover, be careful of the handle. it will become very hot during cook.
"
2,"this is one very attractive coffee canister with just one problem. if you're chosing this because you no longer want your food and beverages exposed to plastic, you might want to stay away from this one. the inside area is made entirely of black plastic. however, if plastic isn't an issue for you, this could be your baby.i am disappointed that amazon's normally satisfactory product description process didn't work here. this listing misrepresents the item by failing to mention the non-stainless interior which is a significant fact to many consumers. i returned my canister with my explanation that the quality was not as represented. i don't believe that they should charge their customers for any shipping or restock fees when they don't describe items honestly. amazon rocks but this listing needs help!
"
1,"i bought a pair in maroon and they were a little short but fine. the problem was that they started coming apart at the seams after 2 months. will definitely be looking to a different company for a replacement pair.
"
2,"you can barely hear the music over the static. thought it might just be our car so we tried a couple friends' cars and it was the same. total waste of money.
"
2,"this product would be great if it were durable. over time, it started to sound like i was talking into a can. i could barely hear what the other party was saying. too bad - it was comfortable and worked well for three months.
"
2,"my experience with the explorer 330 has been mixed. on the positive side, under the best conditions the 330 has worked very well -- incoming and outgoing sound are far more clear than what i have been accustomed to with my blackberry 8830 cell phone.i have found, however, that the 330 performs poorly in several fairly common situations. first, background noise is a real problem. i have several times had callers hear nearby conversations more clearly than my voice, and car engine noise has sometimes drowned out speech. as another reviewer has already noted, the 330 is unusable in windy conditions.second, battery life has been much worse than expected. as the battery level falls, the 330 needs to be closer and closer to the phone; otherwise, the person on the other end of the line will hear an unacceptable level of static, although the bluetooth connection will remain intact. in general, i've found that after about two to four hours of talking time, the cell phone needs to be within an inch or two of the headset to function.third, the 330 has a small effective range from the phone to which it is paired. in general, to have acceptable sound quality, i have had to keep my cell phone in a shirt pocket rather than a pants pocket or on a table in the same room. again, this is closely linked to battery life; the 330's range is better if it is within its first thirty minutes after charging.all in all, this has been an adequate headset, but i have been frustrated by the number of situations in which it cannot be effectively used. in hindsight, i probably would not have made this purchase.
"
2,"i ordered this fan for a recent camping trip, and never got to use the fan. i had it set up at the foot of my inflatable mattress, and one of my kids tipped it over accidentally. the fan detached from it's base, and i wasn't going to perform surgery on it during my vacation. the light on it is pretty bright, and we did use it throughout the trip. i'm sure there are much better, more durable fans out there.
"
2,"this isn't even close to authentic or realistic. my 3-year-old said he'd rather use the cheap plastic hats the fire departments pass out than this. the hat's pvc plastic means soft formed and when the description says ""finished with soft red plush trim""--it's on the outside. as soon as we opened this, we knew it was going back.
"
2,"text message does not work, directions in a language i can't even identify, contact with ace photo, the vendor, was unproductive. not a good purchase experience at all.
"
2,"i had this phone for about 5 days before i wanted to toss it out the window. it rings when there is no call comming in and wont stop. i returned it to the store where i bought (t-mobile) it but because it had been 35 days instead of 30, they said they could not exchange it for a new one but would give me a &quot;previously used&quot; phone. after 5 replacements, i bought a nokia. the camera sucks, and the battery life and signal suck too.
"
3,"this company was bought out several years ago by a far east company. the quality is not the same; the warranty is worthless; the 18/10 gauge steel is not truly 18/10 guage and the handles are made of cheap plastic. if one takes the time to look at the positive reviews, most of them are from people who have the original sets manufactured ten to twenty years ago. the company no longer exists, and its successor makes cheap knockoffs of the original. do not waste your money
"
2,"i ordered a battery for a blackberry on october 30th. it didnt arrive by the estimated delivery time, so i emailed, and they asked me to wait until the following monday. so i did, and still no battery! so i emailed again, and all they told me was that they have no control over the usps, and would send me a new one. so now, i have to wait another 2.5 weeks to maybe not receive a battery again!since i received the battery from the seller, i have had email after email demanding i remove this negative feedback from their site. i am not going to do this. they have badgered me over and over to remove it or, and i quote, ""we've only just begun steve. if you refuse to act with even a shred of decency or honor, i will make sure you regret it. remove the negative tonight."" this is the very email i received from sellphonestop customer service last night. i could be wrong, but why in the world would i remove my honest opinion if i believe i was given poor customer service?? obviously, they are beginning to threaten me for my opinion. they really do not care about their customers!! i will never, ever, order from this company again, and i hope anyone who reads this, won't order from then either.
"
2,"the side ripped within 2 days of use. pretty useless now.
"
1,"i bought this shirt for one reason, the price, and i soon as i open the box i found out why it was so cheap. because of the cheap materials. save your money, spend couple of dollars more and you will be happier with quality.
"
3,"this thing is a fire hazard. i bought two of them and the bottom is equal to, if not hotter than the top plate on each. i would not recommend this product as it will ruin furniture at best, and light your home/office of fire at worst.
"
2,"i figured this product would be good considering monster is a solid company, however, every station that i was able to hear my music (zune), there was static, even subtle static was enough to make it not worth the money. i got a cheaper belkin product and it was much better, i found at least one station that gives basically no static. so just get that instead of this for 1/3rd the price. i live near a major city and that may have caused some of the static, but the belkin gets me almost none so it must be the product.
"
2,"this phone/pda has real problems. i too am waiting for joe schmoe's phone to be refurbished by cingular and sent to me. i am just hoping that i am within the warrantee -- something that cingular cannot confirm, although i have had the various phones almost a year -- or just over a year. you are asking for it if you buy this device!
"
2,"i bought 2 of these headsets (one for me and one for the girlfriend) on recommendation by my cingular sales guy. it was either the bt250 for $80 or the moto hs810 for $99.not knowing too much about bluetooth headsets at the time, i opted for the bt250. two weeks later and i'm giddy like a kid in a candy store.it took a while to figure out how to install the headset to your ear, but i'm sure most, if not all, bluetooth headsets share the same minor inconvenience. the other minor inconvenience are the buttons; they don't have a nice feel when you push them and the locations are sometimes tricky.if it's one thing i would really like, then it's a replaceable [rechargeable] battery. i'd really hate to buy a new headset just because the battery will no longer hold a charge.regardless, i have found the bt250 to be a better value than the hs810.
"
2,"a general warning about verizon phones. the coverage is good but the customer service is the terrible. if you choose to do business with verizon get everything in writing and keep good records because they lie and cant find records until you find them and suddenly they magically appear in their records. this has happened to me several times.
"
2,"i have a motto to live by reduce reuse repair recycle. since most americans get a new cellphone every six months to a year, the carrier(it starts with a v} sells you a phone with a battery that will last you two years tops. after two years they stop carrying replacement batteries so they can force you(their loyal customer) to buy another crumby phone that costs the carrier maybe $50 bucks tops so that they can lock you into another contract with a termination fee for the full msrp; lets say 200 dollars. this act of forcing one to buy a new phone every one to two years is fueling a war in central africa where rare metals like coltan and germanium are mined. in 2010 a billion new cellphones will be manufactured with over 200 million of those destined for the usa. if you would like to help end wars for resources buy a replacement battery, keep using that old cellphone, and demand that your carrier give you a discount for preventing bloodshed. i would like to thank this battery manufacture for saving the life of a nameless/faceless child soldier.
"
1,"i think i should have ordered a size smaller. i wore this anyway since it is the first time i've tried to wear something like this. however, i wear this using the second set of hooks. i think i would have gotten more use out of a smaller size, using the first hooks, then the second. that's okay. i'll be ordering a smaller size from this seller soon.it's comfortable and undetectable under clothes.the product arrived on time and was packaged nicely.
"
2,"i didn't even have it a month before the material on the inside came apart. i hardly used it.
"
2,"although it works well for a phone holster, and i still use it today, mine broke just a few months after purchase. poor quality, but it gets the job done.
"
3,"this mug warmer does not keep coffee at the temperature it was when i put the ceramic cup on the warmer. it keeps it warm, yes, but not hot. i still have to reheat it if i leave it for any length of time.it might be fine if you're drinking warm milk, but if you like hot coffee, i think you'll be disappointed -- as i am.the lack of auto shut-off is a problem, but i knew that when i bought it, so i just have to be vigilant about turning it off when i leave my desk.
"
2,"i want to buy this product, but i want it in black.....why should i allow you to choose the color when i'm paying.
"
2,"i bought two sets of these. they're priced at $9.50. but, when they arrived, the price tag still stuck on the item says $2.99. nice way to hide your ""shippign cost"" ($6.51) from your customers! this company goes on my ""never again"" list!
"
1,"the picture and description is of a shirt, what was sent was a sleeveless tank-top, open at the arm pits. don't order this if you expect a shirt or plan to use it for submission grappling.
"
2,"after reading all of the reviews for the fm transmitters i decided i would go the cassette adapter way. it worked for about 2 songs then the player kept spitting it out. one of the reasons that i bought it was the power adapter that came with it. maybe someone will get smart and make one of these things that actually works!!!
"
3,"i would assume whoever packages these items, looks at them -- this should be a round pan -- not a dented pan. the box was not damaged, airpacks around the pan. pan has a serious dent -- not a minor dent. watch what you buy
"
2,"this was the second treo 600 that i got from amazon.com three weeks later some fonctions on the keyboard stop working. when i contacted palm they told the warranty does not cover keyboard failure then i called t-mobile who advised me to backup the data and do a hard reset. still didn't work. i called back on satuday 02/04/2006, palm told me that i have to send them the unit for repaire or pay $25 to get a ""premium exchange option"" and that i would get the unit in 2 to 3 business day. i called back on the following wednesday palm said to wait untill friday.called on friday they said that it could be shipped on monday. i asked to be refunded my $25 because they lied on the terms, the operator said that she could not.
"
2,"i really like these. i like that there are 3 different sizes for each ear. i use the small ones and my husband uses the large ones. it was like they were made just for my ears. i would recommend these even for headphone, not just bluetooth headsets.
"
2,"do not buy this phone unless you're willing to endure continuous calls from verizon wireless if you try to close your account.last week, shortly after telling verizon's sales person i was switching to t-mobile because their customer service is a disaster, i began getting three to five calls each day that hang up as soon as i answer. doing a *69 revealed they were coming from 1-800-470-0768, verizon wireless' number. calling a supervisor (jasen) resulted in an apology and him putting me on their do not call list, which he says won't take effect for 30 days. he also said this is a ""known problem with verizon's auto-dialer"" for which verizon has no solution. it's only noon and so far today i've gotten three calls from them, two hangups and another sales pitch to upgrade my phones and stay with verizon wireless.i'd rather stick needles in my eyes.
"
2,"bought a cell phone battery that, of course, died one week past their return/refund deadline. refused to refund or replace even though the product is clearly defective. this company is a ripoff and will never do business with them again. consider yourself warned.
"
2,"this phone is consistent with the quality of phones i've received from cingular. it's a piece of crap! i too, get no reception in my own house, and it holds a call like greased hands hold a greased ball of grease that was soaked with grease with a grease soaker. it is the worst of the worst. the speaker is crap, of you shift it at all from your ear hole... sorry for the technical lingo... but if you do that, you won't hear anything. it won't charge unless the phone is turned off, and the battery lasts for about two hours of talk time, and about a day of powered on time. the most irritating part is the battery, but the dropped calls is a close second. i swear you can have five bars, but as soon as you push the call button, it will drop to two... do not cheap out and get this phone! upgrade!
"
2,"i'm writing a review for the first time because i've never been so dissapointed with a shopping experience. i bought cell phone cases from world of bags so that i could give them as christmas gifts. i ordered them on december 5th. it took them until december 19th to confirm that they were being shipped! it was as if they were waiting for the last minute to ship me my items. [amazon has a two week policy for shipment of products.] needless to say, i did not get to give them away as christmas gifts. this is the type of service i got for choosing standard shipping -which was very expensive to send two little cell phone cases(i can't specify how much because they won't let me post prices in reviews)! they also shipped them seperately. a sign of inefficiecy, indeed. one came in an appropriately sized bubble envelope and the other in a huge box. i've decided to not return the items because i want to cut my losses now and just never order from them again.
"
1,"i have bought dockers for years but these are cut smaller than they usually are. even with the ""stretch"" waist band they are tight. so much for an ""extra"" inch. beware. try these in a store before you buy.
"
1,"i did not get the slack that had the waistband. i got slack with no waistband, so i send them back an was trying to ge a 42 29 but i received a e mail stateting that the product was no longer avability. so far i'am not sure were my refund went. please let me know.tom atkinson
"
2,"i liked mine at first but it didn't hold up. i've had mine about a month and it's falling apart. it's too bad because i really liked it.as far as the comments from others regarding the phone freezing on when it's open it's the 2 bottons (contacts and message). i found that if you trim the plastic around those bottons that fixes that issue.
"
1,"dockers are dockers, so that's not the problem. just be sure you don't trust the images if you choose to buy these via amazon. ""cafe,"" for example, should be ""coffee."" despite the fact that the image for ""cafe"" shows a stone or very light gray color, ""cafe"" is actually dark brown. so the product isn't defective, but is misleading: i didn't want brown pants, but that's what i got.

"
1,"i did not like the texture/material. the fitting was also loose for me. having used eddie bauer cotton shirts, these shirts were disappointment.
"
2,"if you want to spend $53 for one tiny trash can then this is the deal for you. this product should have been sold as a 6 pack but unfortunately someone messed up when they entered this product for sale. both amazon and geroy's deny responsibility for the error and to date nothing has been changed. it was really disappointing to get this in the mail & then have to turn around and return it. also, you can't return this product without talking with someone at the amazon call center. this purchase was a huge waste of time and i'm disappointed that it's still available.
"
3,"while i agree this pan is good looking, it's not good cooking! takes a long time to heat up and bottom does not heat evenly. if i'd known farberware had changed their ""classic"" pan, i wouldn't have bought it. my advice--look for another brand.
"
2,"we purchased six of these heaters in february 2006, and by november 2006 only one was still working. one was doa, two died within one week of arrival, and the other two died over the next seven months. we live in southern california so these heaters were rarely used so its not like they wore out. repeated calls to delonghi customer service went unanswered, and the local service company they refer to in their service manual is no longer in business. we are very disappointed with the heaters and delonghi and would not buy one from them again.
"
2,"i bought this phone about fifteen months ago and was initially very pleased. lots of features, really cool sounding stereo sound from the stereo speakers. but.... i use my cell phone average 1500 minutes a month. the slide does not hold up. the phone sections separated on one side, i got a sim card failure message on the phone screen and the off button would not turn the phone off. removed the battery and it is now dead on my desk, will not turn on with battery reinstalled. $300 for fifteen months is a little pricey.
"
2,"when i first received this case i was impressed with how clear it was and how sleek. it did not take any beauty away from the phone itself. however, the clip is way too big and bulky - an inch thick and does not hold well at all. for being so big, one would think it would have to be strong as well, but that is not the case with this clip. the second day i had the case, it cracked in the center where the thin piece of plastic is located between the screen and trackball - and this happened from me putting my pearl in my center console on its side. then, a couple of days later it cracked again and then the middle piece broke off alltogether. the case protected the phone, since the phone did not get damaged or scratched, but the case itself needs a protector to keep it intact. so, the one star is for the good looking nature of this case but not the protection or lack thereof.
"
1,"this is the first time i've had anything negative to say about under armour,and my complain is not really about the product, but the company, as the 2 shirts i ordered was to be short sleeved, and they arrived as sleeveless,it was a birthday gift to my grandson, and he assured me it was ok. i went along with him, but when i received this letter asking if i would rate the transaction, i had to tell you.i will think twice before i order again, this was a plain and simple order, and you messed it up.if i had had time i would have returned them for the right kind, but they were delivered on the birthday so i gave the package to him as it arrived,ibg1105
"
2,"good news = the bluetooth works, had not problem synching to my blackberry.bad news = horrible clarity, if there is any sort of road noise the person on the other end cannot hear you! (whats the point of hands free?!?!) you never know when the bluetooth is low on battery, and you cant turn it off..if you turn it on it runs for a long time. sometimes when you already have it on your year and you want to end a call it will not end the call. when you want to make a call it goes to ""voice command"" instead of just regular dial which can be annoying because your phone cant hear you on the bluetooth. the sound gets very garbled if you are more than a foot away from your phone (again whats the point) i have heard bad things about all bluetooth headsets so this is just like all the others, but its a good price so if you really need one get it anyway (rather pay less then more for a crapy product in general)
"
2,"i would like to buy two or more shells, do you offer differents colors to choose from? wich colors are there? this is because i would like to pay only one shipping fee. please answere asap.
"
3,"i searched amazon for ""shower curtain rod, nickel"" and this product is returned in the results. from the image, it looks just like other shower curtain rods sold on amazon; however, this rod is only about 1/2 inch in diameter and will not work as a shower curtain rod. don't be fooled like i was.
"
2,"i've been wearing the waist clincher for the last two years. i purchased a new one recently and it's not the same type of material of the previous ones i've brought. i thought maybe because i had lost weight, so i brought a smaller sizer, but that one didn't fit the same either. i thought i found a miracle when i first purchased the girldle through amazon, but i have found my recent purchase has surely let me down...
"
2,"the product is absolute crap. the usb cable is faulty and does not properly fit into the keyboard or the computer jack. once i managed to get both ends to insert (with great care and effort) did the keyboard charge? nope. also the pairing button didn't work.avoid avoid avoid. do not buy this product.
"
2,"the sizes run really small, it flips up even though, they said it would not and the hooks don't hold. i am very dissapointed.
"
1,"i purchased one of these shirts from sport check and paid $30 for it. it was comfortable and i had no problems with it until 1 day i noticed some white flakes on the front of it. when i tried to wipe them off i saw that it was the material that was flaking off in a perfect circle. the more i brushed the bigger the hole grew. now you can see through the center of my shirt like some nylon stockings, which looks pretty girly. for a $30 shirt i sure expected to get a lot more wear out of it.
"
3,"i agree this is a solid cookware. but it is so hot on the handles everytime i try to remove it from the stove. i believe they can do something about the design of the handles. btw, my hands are not so sensitive to heat normally. but this is super hot beyond my tolerance.
"
2,"i was unable to return the item because of restrictions imposed by their return policyi made a mistake by buying it
"
2,"this is a nice holder but it does break if your not careful. i just ordered my 3rd one because they seem to break easy when getting into my truck, this could be avoided if you swivel the phone before you enter a car seat. this is not a faulty design just the end user being lazy and not being careful getting in and out of a vehicle.
"
1,"shirts of average quality...worth about what i paid for them, $10.00.....built in collar stays...
"
1,"i bought these shirts for $6 each thinking that i've got a bargain, but once i received them was disappointed in my purchase. as previous reviewers mentioned, the material is flimsy, 60% cotton - 40% polyester (and feel like the latter), the fit is improper and finish poor. am wearing one of the shirts now, and it wears uncomfortably (feels like a poorly made medical scrub) and looks just as cheap (yes, even the french blue color). will either send these back or they will end up collecting dust in my closet.
"
2,"pros: fits firmly in either ear. looks good. holds charge for a long time.cons: amplifies surrounding noise (even air flow from vents)! slow to connect when answering a call. connection with handset fades in and out on any call at anytime in any location.i would never recommend this product to anyone. 2-stars.
"
2,"this is the worst thing ever made! when you get the case, it looks nice and all, but here's the catch: it won't fit! you can jam it and pull it all you want but it won't work. the only thing that does work is cutting the case with some scissors. this is horrible, selling a case that doesn't fit the phone.
"
2,"this is a great product and it was a great price, however it does not work with mp3 player on the samsung blast phone. otherwise it seems to be ok. too bad the product description does not mention it will not work with mp3 players. i think thats poor technical writting.
"
2,"antonline sent a lenmar battery were the case was barley held together by scotch tape on both ends once i open the package. the box was smashed but packaging was not. emailed right away as instructed and waited for rma or contact back. no response. tried again plus tried calling but still no response so then i emailed amazon. amazon gave me a full refund after their investigation of the problem. thank you amazon.

2,"this is the absolute worst cellphone i have ever owned! i think that this phone is poorly made. every friend that i have that owns this phone all have the same problems. after less than a month the screen started blanking out and the &quot;flip&quot; has &quot;flopped&quot;! not to mention the camera sucks! i thought that i just got a bad model and i planned to return it, until i was told by more than a few friends that they all had similar problems. i'm switching to the nokia 3650. let's see how that goes...
"
2,"i purchased this product and it was great for about a month. the other day i was getting out of my car and the clip broke off from my belt. the phone fell into the street and was destroyed by oncoming traffic. i'm out a $400.00 phone because of the cheap plastic used in this product. if your looking for durability look elsewhere.
"
1,"i have bought dockers for years but these are cut smaller than they usually are. even with the ""stretch"" waist band they are tight. so much for an ""extra"" inch. beware. try these in a store before you buy.

1,"if you are looking for bill blass quality (go and check it out in a store), then keep away from this.on the other hand, if you are looking for a cheap shirt, then this is the real thing.
"
2,"good:the unit produces good (maybe even above average) sound for most lay people. pairing with the analog adapter was easy; and, pairing with laptop, desktop, and cell phone were very straightforward.bad:the design of the headset unit is rather small. the (muted silvery) parts of the headset that connect the top part to the ear ""cups"" (speakers) are very cheap. the top (black) part is rather stiff.ugly:if you have a wide or big head, you will need to spread the headset a lot everytime you put it on. when you do that, the muted silvery part will break sooner than later. it will break either around the area where it connects to the top (black) part or the other side where it connects to the ear ""cup"" units.bottom line:if you have small head, this is most likely be a very good bluetooth stereo headsets for you. otherwise, be very careful when putting them on your head and expect them to break.

3,"only keeps coffee tepid at best. actual element gets very hot; it just doesn't reach the coffee. item is small enough to stay on the table. it makes an expensive coaster.
"
2,"i have been using the jabra freespeak bt250 for almost a year now. it is pretty good. the only issue i have with it is sometimes it does not speak well to my cell phone if my phone is in my shirt pocket (left side) and the jabra is on the right ear.recently, i lost the ear piece so i purchased the motorola hs810 to try it out as the cingular store guy recommended it. i tried using the motorola hs810 for about one week and found everyone telling me my calls were full of static and that they could not hear me.so i ordered another jabra bt250 and am again very happy! wish i could return the motorola ...michael zyda
"
2,"i bought this product in may 2011 from another vendor (sleep warehouse) based on a lower price. so i can't comment on best beds as a merchant. but what i have to say about the sensus 5 pound/3"" deep queen-sized mattress topper is worth considering, regardless of where you might buy it.1. i bought the sensus to help with ""pressure points"" discomfort from side-sleeping on a very good, firm mattress. to my surprise, the foam topper, while helpful, did not eliminate the pressure point problem. i naively assumed that putting a soft layer on top of a firm mattress would improve my sleeping experience, but unfortunately it did not completely address pain in shoulders/hips from side sleeping.2. the product caused other problems i did not anticipate. within a few days of starting to use the sensus, i began having aches in my lower and middle back. before using sensus, i had never experienced routine lower and mid back problems from my sleeping arrangements. as you consider whether to buy sensus, think about whether it could actually cause pain in parts of your body that are not problematic right now. for me this was the deal breaker.3. i think sensus caused my lower/mid back problems because it is too soft. this is ironic, since many reviews rave about 5 pound density being the best and firmest choice. but it really isn't firm, which is kind of the point because the big selling point is that it will alleviate pressure point problems. 5 pound density may be ""firm"" relative to cheaper, lower density foam, but it is not truly ""firm"".so you've got this foam layer which is soft, but not ""too"" soft -- it is firm enough that you can still have pressure point issues, while being soft enough to cause lower and middle back pain. everyone is different, but if you buy sensus you're gambling that its softness level will relieve pressure points while not causing other back problems. don't assume you will achieve this optimal result.perhaps if i'd bought a 2 inch thickness the softness of the foam would have blended optimally with the firmness of my mattress to alleviate pressure point issues while not creating lower/mid-back problems. but i'll never know....4. the sensus is very fragile and very unwieldy. it is extremely easy to damage it, especially in the unpacking process. you have to pry apart the foam -- it sticks pretty tightly to itself and the prying apart process is time consuming and quite tricky.the fragility of sensus is ideal for merchants because if you want to return the product (as i do) any damage will prevent you from persuading the merchant to take it back. the 5 pound density, 3"" deep topper weighs about 50 pounds in queen size, so getting it out of the package, unpeeling it into a flat rectangle, coaxing it into a fabric encasement and then getting it atop your bed is quite a job. and then if you decide to return it, the whole process has to be gone through in reverse... and you can only return it if all of this labor proceeds with no damage taking place with the topper.i assure you that it is virtually impossible to unpack, unfold, encase, install, de-install, de-encase, re-fold and re-pack this topper without some damage occurring. therefore it is very unlikely you'll be able to return this sensus product, so do think very carefully before buying it. despite my best efforts, mine has several divots on the edges and some dirt in one spot where the packaging opened up en route to my house, so it is probably a total loss. with the cover that's $409 down the drain. i might try cragislist, or i might just send it off to a charity. or i might just chop it into little bits and landfill it. not sure yet what i'll do with this thing now that i'm done with it in just 3 weeks...5. sensus has an odor. many people write about odors emanating from various mattress toppers, and the stories are quite true. i aired my sensus out on the floor for 4 days before installing it, and even now some 3 weeks later it is still smelly. the odor is more musty than chemical -- think mildewed linens smell more than new shower curtain smell. i am unsure whether the mildewy smell is because of how the topper was warehoused before shipment or is inherent to this type of foam... for me it is not a huge issue, but for those who really dislike odors in their sleeping products it needs to be considered.6. when you see photos of a hand print in ""memory"" foam with the hand hovering over the print it has just etched in the foam, do not take those photos at face value. the photos imply the ""memory"" foam has a pronounced tendency to hold whatever form is pressed into it for an extended time period. but no....i tested this sensus topper -- stuck my hand deep in the foam, held it there for 30 seconds with consistent pressure, and then quickly withdrew my hand. it takes less than 4 seconds for any trace of my hand imprint to vanish. the photos imply something much longer, and it just ain't so. with standard high density foam you get no ""memory"" and with this expensive stuff you get a 3.5 second ""memory"". standard foam costs far, far less than this stuff, so is it worth hundreds of dollars for 3.5 seconds of ""memory""?
"
2,"i loved everything about this phone except for one minor detail...nobody could hear a word i was saying....most of my conversations consisted of "" what, what did you say....!!!!"" yikes that was awful....i believe the internal atenna is a large design problem...however, enough of a problem to return the pretty, picture taking masterpiece....
"
2,"only regret was that ship/hand. was 3 times what the product was - poor planning on my part - but i needed it. it's nice to be able to get the real mfg. products here thru amazon !
"
3,"i was very disappointed with this. it barely keeps my mug of coffee warm - barely luke warm for that matter. i don't recommend this product.
"
2,"i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear. the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear. they seem to be made of a very thick silicone that has a slightly slippery feel to them. i was really disappointed with these. stay away if you have small ear canals.
"
1,"i had got these for my husband for christmas. nice material, however they were too tapered at the ankle and also short for him and he is average height, so we had to return it.
"
1,"i read a previous review that said hers got a run the first time she used them and i figured i'd just be more careful...mine got a run the second time i used them! unless you're desperate, don't bother. i expected better quality for the price i paid!
"
2,"i ordered these tights on dec. 17. i waited, and waited and waited. they were a christmas gift for my sister. it took a full month -- until jan. 12 -- for an email from the company. they mysteriously canceled my order. thanks, guys! guess there's always next christmas.
"
3,"it worked for me cause i was using after having a baby in the winter. on warm weather, it would be way too hot.
"
2,"i bought a new sch8500 and it's fallen out of this holster at least 4 times in the past 2 months! sure it seems to lock in quite nicely, but as soon as you nudge into something, the phone falls to the ground! my phone is now broken because of this and i'm waiting to recieve a replacement; if they'll even send me a replacement! you can bet i'll buy full leather phone protector when/if i get my new phone back. do yourself a big fat favor and get a holser that protects the entire phone. all you need to do is drop the phone just once and it's all over...!
"
2,"i had these bowls on my wedding registry and my sister in law ordered them for me. the first time they came, they were all broken and cracked. we thought it was probably during shipping that it happened so we sent away for a replacement. the second set came, and two were in tact, the other one had a crack down the side. i just let it go and continued to use them...well....4 months later, they were stained, they all had cracks in them, down the sides, on the bottom (which means that anytime i put liquid in them they leak). they are practically falling apart after 4 months of use. kitchenaid can do better than this...i was very dissappointed!
"
2,"this corset makes me sweat like a hog, i am not i'm a petite woman just looking for structure to maintain a flat stomach. theres no doubt it gave me a fantastic shape, was flawlessly discreet under my clothes but i was forced to stop wearing it, because by the end of the day it was very uncomfortable, hot and sweaty underneath. this was bad for my skin too, it made it dry and would have gotten red and irritated if i kept wearing it and for longer periods. it got to the point where it was pointless to wear because the was no breathing for my skin underneath it and i'd want to take it off immediately, so i never wore it, and just gave up and returned it. still looking for a perfect corset, this however is not it. don't waste your time.
"
2,"the battery and cover is great...the phone i put it into isn't the greatest...the battery will probably out live the phone!!!
"
2,"this cell phone is for people who want an updated phone in mobile technology, and of course to talk and call people. the features are great, and this sleek cell phone will fit almost everywhere. color screen and a voice recorder, you'll find something that you'll like!
"
2,"i find it very frustrating not to be able to choose my own color! if this practice was changed, i might order this product!
"
1,"i purchased one of these shirts from sport check and paid $30 for it. it was comfortable and i had no problems with it until 1 day i noticed some white flakes on the front of it. when i tried to wipe them off i saw that it was the material that was flaking off in a perfect circle. the more i brushed the bigger the hole grew. now you can see through the center of my shirt like some nylon stockings, which looks pretty girly. for a $30 shirt i sure expected to get a lot more wear out of it.
"
2,"this isn't even worth it for a basic collector. there isn't a temperature display, but the large problem here is that the temperature control switch offers no range at all. you could for example set it to highest or lowest settings and get no difference at all in actual temperature. not only that but the temperature is too cold for red wine to be properly stored. i hate to be a perfectionist here but hey, isn't that why we buy these things in the first place? i've spoken with other former owners of this hassle of a cooler and heard the same review. the best part was when i called to tell danby of the problem customer service told me the problem was an isolated problem they've never had before and that the temperature should be able to be adjusted. so i sent back and received another, then another. none of them ever got warmer (or colder) than 45 degrees and i have sent it back a final time. keep shopping around!
"
3,"absolute waste of money. what arrived was knock off crap that smelt like petrol and was slightly greasy/slippery to the touch.i left them sitting outside their packaging for a month so see if they improved but all they did was make the area smell like them.given the price and cost to return not worth the trouble to send back however i would never buy from these guys again.am fairly surprised at the comments of quality etc - suggest people go and see what the real thing looks/feels/smells! like in a retail store.
"
2,"this is a good chart with good design. but one major problem....the chart is printed on three boards. however, with the fabrics in between the boards, the measurements end up being off!!! so your child will be measured a fraciton of an inch short! i am going to try to return it. if not, then i will need to tape the boards closer together.
"
2,"like the others, i will not buy this item unless i can chose the color. of course the color matters. the company must not understand that customers like choices.
"
2,"i bought the black and the white ones of these. the black is much nicer looking. is not too bulky and allows you access to all the functions. can't beat this!
"
2,"the specs for this product state that it universally fits all jawbone headsets. it does not. it does not fit the jawbone era.
"
2,"the blackberry curve was smaller and lighter than i thought it was. the keys were too small and hard to read. i returned it! also, the first bill from at&t was around $160. glad i did not have to pay it!!!
"
1,"great shirt in most respects, but way too small. i bought the adult small for my 12-year-old son, who is 5 ft even, 115 lbs, and it is so skin-tight he could barely breathe in it. i'm exchanging it for the non-compression version.
"
3,"i am a modest coffee drinker. i drink 4 cups a day, and i require little of a coffeemaker other than an on/off button. my last perfectly servicable mr. coffee 4-cup machine bit the dust, so i replaced it with this one, because at least i could re-use the carafe.well, the internal design guys have been at the guts of this one. first, you can no longer remove, rinse and/or wipe down the internal chamber condensation from your last pot. you have to insert a papertowel into the new internal resevoir, scraping your hand on some internal parts that probably weren't meant to be messed with. they have likewise redesigned the basket, and it barely fits the standard coffee filters anymore, without crinkling and leaving grounds in your pot, and, hey, the internal water resevoir, where it has no business backwashing anyway. and god forbid you should try to make 5 cups in your 4-cup machine, for which there is plenty of room in the carafe, and in the resevoir, and which works well in many other 4-cup machines. my coffee maker lives on top of my microwave on a little shelf, by the toaster oven, because i have no counterspace for it. i have to lift it out some 10 inches, fill it up, insert the basket, and put it back on the microwave to process. i have mastered the art of moving a fully water loaded machine the little bit required. this one sloshes water everywhere. from the top of the machine? no! there's an engineered hole in the back of the reservoir to keep you from overfilling the chamber that last little bit. water fountains everywhere from the center back part of the machine. i suppose i could put a piece of duct tape over it, but who wants duct tape in their coffee. good god.i will be replacing my machine shortly, then gleefully smashing my carafes on the driveway.
"
2,"not worth the money. under normal use, wearing it on my belt :-) duh, it broke in less than a month. the plastic pin that allows you to swivel the holster is the weak link. the case itself is great, soft leather but the cheap plastic swivel design is poor. go buy a blackberry silicone skin case instead to protect the blackberry and then pick up an after market cheap holster at wal mart and you'll be much happier..
"
1,"i purchased an under armour compression tee at a local store in a size large. the shirt fit fantastic. i wanted a back up so i purchased this one online size large, different color. the shirt arrives on time, open the package and it is a large but does not even fit over my shoulders.... i contacted the vendor for an exchange. they do not do exchanges but will allow me to return the shirt. if the shirt was worn it has to be washed before returning it... no problem for i could not get the shirt on anyway so tags etc were all in place. if you pass 30 days, there is a restocking fee of 20% which i was unaware of.when i questioned the vendor why i have a large and ordered the same size it did not fit. the vendor stated that under armour has different sizing charts for different shirts. that just did not make sense. how are you to buy a product with ""floating"" sizes.so, i went online to nordstrum to find the same exact heat guard compression tee. there was a size chart that could be pulled up to check size before ordering.... only 1 chart for under armour. i did all the measurements correctly to find that i was to order a large.i know the shirt fits tight but since i already had a large that fits, and the chart from under armor at nordstrum confirmed that i had ordered the correct shirt size, the statement that there are different size charts for different under armour shirts "" just doesn't fit!"".i personally will visit a store and actually try it on to avoid the hassle and disappointment of waiting for a product that does not fit, seemingly was ordered correctly, and then had to be mailed back.
"
1,"i ordered this item for support being that i have a rather large chest. the item had much more coverage than the picture lets on and came in the size i ordered according to the tag but once i had it on i realised it was 3 sizes too small. when i returned it to the sender the refunded only half my money. this item was ordered with one more bra like it and out of my $40 order i got just over $20 back. i plan on disputing this with amazon and the seller.
"
2,"i think burton is onto something excellent here..... however, it'll probably be another year or two before its technology is perfectedfirst off - the jacket is excellent! very flexible, warm, and waterproof --- so no complaints on the jacketit is the technology that disappoints methe jacket has a neat construction --- you keep your ipod on one side of your chest and your phone on the other side, with a remote on your wrist that pretty much controls both devicesthe phone functions are neat because calls come through immediately, with the speakers in the hoodie allowing you to hear the other person calling and a mic in the front part allowing you to talk ---- the entire setup is pretty convenient and pretty solid, as people could hear me well and i could hear themhowever, the speaker could be better..... calls and music come through clear, but i wish it were much louderthe ipod functions are what really upset me though -- the ipod is slow to respond to the wrist controls functions.... in addition, sometimes the ipod functions won't work if you have the phone connected on bluetoothoverall -- the stability of the jacket's system needs to be worked out --- i'm pretty impressed with it, but wait another year for burton to fix this onepeace and love and happy buying!!!!!!muhammad ali hasan
"
2,"works fine for 3 days then breaksif you wear the phone all the time, go in and out of chairs and cars, or do anything physical this will break.
"
2,"unfortunately i have to buy a new bluetooth headset every couple of months or so because i lose them all the time. this one was no different because i lost it too, a few weeks ago, and replaced it with the samsung wep475 bluetooth headset which i like much better. quite honestly, i've had a few plantronics headsets in my time and i never really cared for any of them.
"
2,"after trying three different sizes,i still couldn't find one that fit. i first ordered a medium and it wouldn't even come close to hooking so i went up to size to xlarge which was waaay to big, my last possible option would be a large and it was still huge, wish i would have sent it back but was just tired of the whole process and kept it. the hooks are a pain as well and it is way over priced.....there is a zippered option on amazon that is much cheaper.
"
3,"when i received this, not only was it way too small for me, the first and only thing i noticed was the horrible smell that came out of the packaging! it was unbearable, sort of like a burnt rubber smell. there's no way i would recommend this to anyone. there are definitely other products on the market that do the job!!
"
2,"covers the charging port for your razr phone. so when you decide to charge your cellphone, you are forced to take whole plastic cover off first. very inconvenient.
"
2,"the product states that inches will be removed after 30 days of use and i have worn this item everyday for at least 12 hrs per day and i have not seen any kind of difference.for the price of the item, it is disappointing when it advertises and does not comply.
"
2,"the phone is neat and comes with a lot of great features, but buyer beware-the warranty is basically non-existant. we had a problem with the keyboard and called for warranty service and they said that the warranty is invalid if there is any water damage. we explained that there was no water damage, it just stopped working. they asked us to check a ""dot"" sensor on the phone. if the dot is red, the warranty is invalid. we asked how the dot could be red when the phone (2 months old) never got wet, and their rep told us that rain, sweat or being exposed to humidity or condensation! an unscientific survy of razr uses at a soccer game found 4 of 5 with the dot turned red-and hense no warranty.so bottom line is, it is a good phone, as long as you don't sweat or live in a location where it rains or gets humid.
"
1,"if you search for super saver shipping this advertisement comes up, but this product is not shipped by amazon is does not go out with the super saver shipping, and the cost of shipping is nearly 20% the cost of the pants.
"
3,"that is correct! after 2 years of light use, i noticed a pool of water on the counter around this miserable piece of garbage.why would a piece of stainless steel develop a leak? what nonsense.get something else, anything!!
"
2,"this would be great if it had boning in it. i am not sure if this os because i have a very pronounced hour glass figure, but when i put it on, the fabric slides the the waist and it has the same effect as if i had a rubber band aroun my waist, forming a bulge above and below my waist. too bad- i had hoped this would work based on reviews.
"
2,"when i first got this phone i was very excited about it, but now i am ready to bail out from t-mobile and get a different phone and plan.1) the coverage is lousy. as soon as you leave a metro area, you lose coverage. there seems to be no roaming option with t-mobile, unlike other phone companies.2) the phone is an interesting toy, but the camera is unwieldy and doesn't work very well. the pictures are dim, blurry, and the screen has poor resolution. altogether a disappointing experience.
"
2,"two loops are provided with the head set. the loops are made of hard plastic. both broke in the same place within 2 weeks. nothing is provided to put the head set in. voice recognition is very sensitive any change in tone the name is not recognised. hearing conversations is good. volume buttons are little small to use.
"
3,"i recently purchased this mug warmer to keep my coffee warm while working at my desk. i plugged it in, turned it on and there was a *pop* sound, a spark, and then a little smoke. nice idea and all but i'll take the trek to my microwave over a fire hazard.

"
2,"i was incredibly disappointed when i got a message a few days after i made and paid for my order that said ""we don't have this item in stock. it could take up to two weeks. if after two weeks we don't ship your order, then may can opt to cancel it."" those aren't the exact words, but it was something to that effect. also, i had already paid for priority shipping, which i did not receive and did not get reimbursed for. this was one of the three items on my ticket. the other items were not important and shipped fairly fast. the blackberry battery that i ordered on a priority basis, was critically important, and didn't arrive for about two weeks. while amazon has been good to me over the years, this was a frustrating and disappointing experience.
"
2,"the battery does not hold a charge - don't buy this phone unless you want to talk with your phone plugged into a wall. i had a nokia phone for 4 years before i bought this phone and i loved it. as soon as i can i will replace this phone.
"
2,"while this may be one of the better ones, it still didn't work with my treo 750. the sound comes out only out of one car speaker. i had to buy an additional plug to convert the 3.5mm jack into 2.5mm.
"
3,"i was looking for a coffee machine with a thermal caraffe. at first, the cofee was great. then a couple of weeks later, coffee started to pour directly out of the machine onto the floor! i thought maybe i had a bad machine, so i took it back to the store and exchanged it for a new one. a month later, same problem! the coffee pours around the caraffe, not into it. i burned myself trying to clean it up, and it stained my nice kitchen floors. i'm taking it back for a different brand coffee maker, i won't be fooled three times!
"
2,"i thought this product was great at first. it fits nicely and lasts a long time without needing to charge it. however, everyone i talk to say that they hear tons of background noise. the microphone picks up on everything around you and the person listening cannot hear you very well. i have to buy another.
"
2,"this charger works great on my motorola razr v3m, but i'd just like to point out that this is not as pictured. the m on the front of the cigarette lighter jack does not light up blue, but rather there is a blue led beneath the m. this is obviously, as another reviewer stated, a knock off of the original. i'd purchase this again however, as it's $3 instead of the $8 for the one with the light-up m.
"
2,"recently, i've been having problems with charging my samsung n400 phone. i have a charger with a single prong that fits into the phone base. unfortunately, the socket of my phone is rather loose and sometimes the charger doesn't make a connection.i purchased this charged because the picture showed a multi-pin plug to fit in the alternate interface on my phone. i required this interface since my single prong socket was loose/damaged. the charger i received does not match this picture as it has the traditional single prong. granted, it does work for the samsung n400, but doesn't match the product picture so in a sense was falsely advertized.secondly, the plug that goes into the cigarette lighter has a lead post that is sprint loaded. this ensures it makes contacts with the cigarette lighter recepticle. however, this lead post presses into the charger head and does not spring out; it sticks. in other words, it doesn't make contact with the cigarette lighter socket and therefore doesn't conduct electricty to charge my phone.false or inaccurate advertizing coupled with shoddy construction left me very disappointed with this purchase.i would not recommend this product.
"
1,"great shirt in most respects, but way too small. i bought the adult small for my 12-year-old son, who is 5 ft even, 115 lbs, and it is so skin-tight he could barely breathe in it. i'm exchanging it for the non-compression version.
"
1,"this was purchased for my daughters halloween costume. beware! very cheap material! the sizes are different from what it reads online, and the pieces of the costume are different sizes. for example: the skirt is waaaay too small but the pullover &#34;boots&#34; fit just fine. as all the other reviews claim, the outfits &#34;color/graphics&#34; peeled off because it was stuck to the plastic package. i do not recommend this unless they are only using it for dress up.
"
3,"this mug warmer does not keep liquid hot. i purchased this one to replace my old mug warmer that kept coffee at a perfect temperature. this mug warmer barely keeps the coffee lukewarm. don't waste your time or your money on this product.
"
2,"the charger i recieved was missing a lot of prongs therefore it wouldn't charge. it was a waste of my money and time. do not by this charger you won't regret it
"
3,"i bought the thing, then read the reviews. i tried everything including using a flat bottom cup for maximum contact, pre-heating the cup and making sure the coffee was hot when put on the device. i left the warmer on for 5 minutes so it was ""hot"" before putting the coffee on it. when one does this, the coffee cools off(!) when on the warmer. gets cooler! it simply does not run hot enough to work. it does work if you only put an inch of pre-heated coffee in a pre-heated cup. then it keeps it semi hot. i took mine back to bb&b.
"
2,"we purchased this microwave in october for $300 minus the $50 rebate. panasonic denied our first rebate submission, claiming we'd bought the wrong item. a phone call cleared up the misunderstanding and apparently our rebate is on its way. however, i've since been told that rebate problems and denials are a common occurrence with panasonic.the microwave has a nice appearance and functions well. however, there is a significant design flaw. you cannot use the hood light as a nightlight or even keep it on for very long without heating up the inside of the microwave to the point where the internal fan comes on and the microwave will not turn on to cook. after the oven cools down, it seems to function normally. the first time this happened, the inside of the oven was so hot i thought it was a short circuit. for that reason, i do not recommend buying this appliance. i wonder if this is why the price has dropped dramatically...

1,"i did not expect this top to be skin tight. the other armour exercise shirt i have is a comfortable fit. it is partly my own fault because i did not realize the significance of &#34;compression&#34; fit.
"
1,"my husband doesn't like to wear shirts under his dress shirts; however, he will have to with these. i ordered 2 whites and 1 tan. they are nice looking but very, very thin. the retail tags say $45. i'd be quite upset if i had paid that much! i guess for $9.99, they'll be okay. i didn't save a lot though cause now i have to buy some new t-shirts to wear underneath! if you don't have a white-collar job, these would be fine (at a reasonable price) for occassional wear. however, my husband has to wear them everyday, and i doubt they will hold up well since they are so thin.
"
2,"please do notttttt buy thisssss!!!!!! the phone doesn't slide open with this cover on. if you still try real hard.. the cover comes off with it.. it almost spoilt my display.. pleaseeee do not buy this.. unless u hate ur phone
"
2,"this came with my phone...and i really like the phone, but this charger is one cheap piece of crap. i've gone through two of these, and now just use the car adapter charger instead.
"
2,"i ordered it on april 11, now it's apr. 29. i just found that it's going to be shipped on may 12th.it is just a trash can. are you casting this after getting order? custom made? what's wrong with you? i don't cancel this order only because it was supposed to be included in free super saving shipping.
"
2,"for as much as it costs, its a piece of junk. most fm transmitters are, i heard some good things about this one, so i thought it would be better, and it wasnt =(, and i dont even live in the city, it has alot of static, and garbled, underwater
"
1,"the picture and description is of a shirt, what was sent was a sleeveless tank-top, open at the arm pits. don't order this if you expect a shirt or plan to use it for submission grappling.
"
3,"i like the mr coffee cup warmer in most respects. however, a couple of features that are sorely missing and i am surprised that this product can be marketed without them.there is no auto shutoff switch. i have had other cup warmers in the past that would shutoff after an hour. they also had a sensor that would shut off if no cup was present.i have left my cup warmer on with no cup sitting there a burning all night when i was sleeping. how much more would it cost to add these important safety and energy conservation capabilities.i would gladly pay the difference.
"
2,"product worked for about a week then not anymore, sometimes intermittent. had to order one from the sony co. direct.
"
2,"purchased locally. i figured if any issues i would return.i had my player with me. (creative zen vision:m)plugged in, found an empty frequency, tried to set the unit. unit would not set! -/+ buttons didn't work.also, if you have a somewhat large hand, you won't find this an easy unit to set.returned within 20 minutes to the store where purchased. didn't bother with trying another. monster need better quality control.
"
2,"as a whole i would not recommend this phone to buyers.yes, the phone is small, ""cute"" and has nice accessibility to volume buttons and there is a camerahowever :- the camera has poor resolution- t-mobile reception is awfulin places where other cell phones with tmobile received one or two lines, mine had no signal.after leaving some place where there was no reception and going out into open air, the phone takes upto 1.5 minutes to pick up the signal (sometimes it works if you turn it off and then on again)many times when i change time zones, the cell doesnt pick up the new time and date.- the software hangs!!the software is awful - it hangs at least once every 24 hrs and often times more.that's enough typing for now...i would suggest you look for a better phone...
"
2,"i purchased the non-stick set a few years ago. within a year, the nonstick finish was wearing off. i worked a long time on getting this problem taken care of - seems farberware was bought by another company a few years back, and no one wanted to take responsibility (a lifetime guarantee) for my falling-apart cookware. finally, they said they would resurface my pans. i sent them all ($25 in shipping!) in to a company in pennsylvania.......who had them for six months!!!!! they wouldn't return calls, they totally disregarded my plea's for information about my cookware, they didn't care. i had to buy a couple of peices of inexpensive cookware, just so i could put meals on the table. i thought it would possibly take 3 to 4 weeks, but they kept me hanging the whole time. finally, after i waited for those 6 months, my cookware arrived, without my large frying pan. of course, 3 weeks of phone calls back to them, got me no where. i still don't have my pan. that was 2 years ago, and the nonstick surface of the resurfaced pans are wearing off again.my advice would be to never buy nonstick surfaces from farberware. actually, i would never buy any farberware. they may be &quot;classic&quot; but they don't stand behind their products.all-clad.....all the way!!
"
2,"i know from experience. i have owned every brand of this type of cable over the years. i think one company makes them all. they will not last. the cable will develop a bare spot near the device connector end and short itself out. for some reason, it only happens with the palm-type cables. my ipod and usb retractable cables have lasted. perhaps one just ends up using the palm device cables more for hot-synching and/or charging daily.see my palm page at [...]
"
2,"bought two of these and it always breaks in the same place after several months of use, if not sooner. other reviewers have had the same experience. the problem lies with the plastic slide where you attach your palm. it is flimsy and not detailed properly re. interface with the metal case itself. it invariably breaks after several openings/closings, if not before. i had a rhino case before on another palm and it looks as if i will have to try that or a leather one again.

1,"first thing you have to know about clothes: there are certain names the are your guarantee of quality (think something like ralph lauren), because these designers impose a certain quality level on the clothes that have their label attached.then there are certain names that mean...nothing. that's because these ""designers"" are simply labels available for license to whatever comes down the pike. bill blass is one of these, at least for cheaper clothes.these shirts represent the very worst of the kinds of clothes that come down that aforementioned pike. slap a bill blass label on them, claim a high list price, and pawn them off on unsuspecting customers via mail order (where you can't see them first, because if you saw them first it wouldn't take you two seconds to realize they stink).these shirts are extremely thin, as has been mentioned before. beyond that, they are not particularly well made. if you care at all about your clothes, you'll regret buying these at any price (including the extremely cheap price at which they are currently available from amazon) and, if you have any self resepct, you'll immediately toss them in that bag you keep for clothes to be donated to the local goodwill store.is it worth even a few dollars to confirm what i'm telling you is true? i say not. why toss your money in the street?

2,"you get what you pay for. this product looks fine, but the belt clip is so wide and bulky that it causes the phone to flop around. not a practical belt clip, but fine if you just want to use the cover alone.

2,"when i first saw this phone i just had to have it. i loved that is was so slick and slim. no antenna was a nice plus as well. i really regret buying this phone!!! my biggest upset was the battery life. the day i recieved the phone i charged it and was ready to go. i made one thirteen min phone call and it already needed to be charged. i went two or three days with the same thing happening and i finally took it back to the store. they(verizon) told me this was common with this phone and that i would have to buy a new and better $[...] battery. needless to say i keep the one i had and it hasn't got any better. i only make 4 or 5 calls a day with no more than an hour usage and have to charge it twice a day. i dropped it(on carpet) and the display screen doesnt work anymore. the only upside to this phone is that its slender. i repeat please don't waste your money!
"
3,"product was not good. the handle ripped off within 5 minutes of a product test drive (which entailed rotating the hand on top to make a ""revolving shoe tree a reality"".) all the pieces were there in the box. but when we put the tree together we put the shoes on and it seemed to hold shoes relatively well, and seemed stable. but when we excessively used the handle to rotate the tree -- this seemed ideal because the motion produced by the handle up toward the top seemed to replicate the same motion of a lighted desert case similar to what you could find at your local diner -- not long after using the handle up on top did it snap off; leaving us with feelings of being ripped off and of buying a relatively cheap product. 35 dollars for a standing shoe tree seems moderately priced, but after it breaking only after 5 minutes of usage, seems to me that the handle is there only to simulate some abstract weird functionality that was not deemed to be used to rotate. not all of the shoe ""branches"" were occupied with shoes, so the amount of weight put onto the handle was not much at all. if you want a standing tree that holds shoes. this is a great buy.
"
2,"warning, plantronics plusar 590a headsets are not mp3 cell phone player compatible.my phone is an lg8100 and others are said to be affected. even though the advertising states they are an ""ultimate stereo bluetooth headset"" and as personally stated by an online rep. ""absolutely compatible with the lg8100 cell phone"", they will not work as such with my phone. unfortunately i purchased these headphones as a solution for allowing good mp3 tunes ""in stereo"" while puttering around my office while at the same time being able to switch to the phone as they quote ""seamlessly"". not! they will not access the mp3 player on the phone. their support personnel wrote me this cop out note when, after purchasing, i inquired why they wouldn't work as their advertising states. ""your phone needs to support the ""a2dp"" profile (advanced audio distribution) in order to enable full stereo sound and streaming audio with the pulsar headset. most currently available phones do not yet support this profile and thus can only make sue of the headset as a mono device for phone calling, not as a media headset for music and other audio outputs."" sorry to sound so negative but to me this was a real bummer and a waste of money. it's kind of stupid running around the office wearing a full stereo headphone set just to answer mono phone calls. be wary,mark

3,"beware...i bought 6 of these with the ridges on the lower part of the mug...since i cannot find replacement mugs for my original (1999) boscoware mugs with ridges on the sides....i was soo disappointed...these tip over precariously, really bad design..i got rid of all of them, and keep hoping boscoware will product the original design...wider at the bottom, more stable, with ridges up the sides..in great colors...i wish i had bought 100 of them!but don't get these...you will regret it!

"
2,"this review is for the sunglass eyeglass repair kit 77pc deluxe sold by: jckringlesi needed some small screws to fix some glasses. i did not expect much to about $8, but i did not think i would get such cr*p. most of the screws had no slot on the end. this means that there is no way to tighten them. they had inserted a note in the kit""screws w/out slots fit into round end of screwdriver and tighten with friction"".no! no! no! it just does not work. first of all, there is no round end of the screwdriver. 2nd, even if there was, there is just no way you could hope to hold down a completely smooth and rounded end of a very little screw, so it could be tightened. to be fair, some of the screws did have slots, but the longer ones did not. the long ones were the only ones that i needed, so this purchase was a complete waste of time & $. i would never order anything else from this store. if they would sell this, then you can not trust them. they obviously got an order of screws that were defective & are trying to get rid of them. just think about it. no one wants little screws ( or orders them that way) with no slots.eyeglass repair kit - 1 kit
"
2,"the cord on the jabra is about two feet too long and no clip is provide for the cord, so it must be coiled up in a pocket if you carry your phone on your belt to keep it out of your way. none of the 6 ear buds included fit very well, the unit sticks out of my ear too far, and people on the other end of phone calls tell me the sound quality stinks.
"
2,"i purchased this from renovaters supply in march 2005. the rod itself is made of solid brass tubing which is why i purchased this. however, the wall of the tubing is made from incredibly thin brass and will bend if you hang a wet towel on it. the chrome plating is also of poor quality. for $100, you would think this would be top quality. don't waste your money on this item.
"
1,"i wore this shirt just once. it's almost transparent. not worth it even if you get it for free.
"
2,"this worked well for about 4 months and then broke. its mechanism turns to ""warm"" now way before the rice is done. when i called the company to ask about service or an exchange, i got someone one time. i had to call back with more information from the receipt and i have never been able to get a hold of someone since then. i have called about 8 other times. it is not worth my time to keep trying to get a hold of someone, pay to send it to a service person, etc. since this item is well reviewed in cook's illustrated, i am debating buying another and crossing my fingers...
"
2,"see my review of the coby ca-745 transmitter for some background.i purchased this monster radioplay 300 based on the price and overall rating. it arrived broken and used. the wire near the socket connector was positional, meaning that it was broken inside and only worked when the wire was at a specific angle; the wire dangles and swings when driving, so the transmitter was unusable. plus, the display and body were both scratched up a lot, so i concluded that the company sent me one that had been returned because it was broken. i assume that the quality control program in their shipping/receiving department needs better management. when i contacted the seller, they apologized, refunded my money and sent me a new one at no cost, so i'd say their pr department is great!the replacement works, and is adequate, but when i received the coby transmitter (which i had ordered right after receiving the first monster), i was blown away at how much better the latter one is, and at a comparable price.so the bottom line is, the company has a qc problem which they can fix, and i wish them the best of luck. their quick and unsolicited response of refunding my purchase price and sending me a workable replacement is a good sign that they are trying, so kudos to them for their effort. as for the transmitter itself, it's okay but just not as good as the coby.
"
3,"it was ok, unless i left it on warm and the rice caked onto the bottom terribly. however, it stopped working after 4 months of use. not sure what happened....
"
2,"i agree that longevity is not in the design specs. i bought one and it worked for less than a year, got a replacement, and that one died even sooner. didn't bother to replace that one. i also had two of the mini ones that plug into the outlet and have a light. one still working after quite a few years, the other, dead. 1 out of 4 is not very good. one note - it does seem to take odors out of the air. i have 4 cats and i think it helped somewhat, but not at the price they want for them. i would give $30 for a floor model if i thought it would keep running. as for cleaning the air - i don't think so.
"
2,"having a nokia go phone that will only be hands free with this headset i had to get it. over all it's a good item. can be hard to hear who your talking to at times if there is a lot of background noise on your end. crystal clear for those hearing you.
"
2,"i'm on my second one of these, because the click-tab on the first one broke. it's not more than a month later, and this one has broken the same way. six dollars may not be much money, but it should buy me a higher quality product than this. and i can't get the clip separately from the holster. if i could get them separately, i would just buy ten of the clips at two bucks a pop, because it isn't the holster that keeps breaking!
"
2,"like the rate plan, like the phone. don't like the way that amazon fulfilled the order, however. evening of day #1: i placed the order. day #2: amazon runs a credit check (as all cellphone vendors do) and i'm approved; so my order status is changed from ""not yet shipped"" to ""shipping soon."" later that day, amazon send me an email to let me know that they've shipped my phones. status changes from ""shipping soon"" to ""shipped."" day #3: amazon send me an email, advising me of my new phone numbers. days #4, #5, #6, #7, #8: still waiting. day #9: phones delivered. ok, so the phones actually arrived during the time period that amazon said they would. so why am i complaining? because on day #3, they had verizon assign phone numbers and activate the phones. so i had the ""privilege"" of paying for phone service on days #3-8 without having the phones in my possession. with a family plan of 4 phones, that was about $18, plus taxes and fees, straight from my pocket to verizon's. gee amazon, thanks for the ""favor"" of activating the phones six days early for me.
"
2,"i was very disappointed in this item. what kind of earphones come with one earbud? it doesn't make sense. and worst of all, the discription didnt even mention that they only came with one earbud. dont waste your time with this product.

"
3,"i purchased this for my father who about 10 times a day puts his cup of coffee in the microwave to warm it up. i figured this would save him a lot of time if it worked. however, it just didn't keep the coffee hot enough. nice idea though.and before anyone comments saying he didnt use it correctly, he did. he poured a fresh cup of hot coffee, used this coffee warmer like a coaster. within about 30 minutes, he had to make another trip to the microwave.
"
2,"i was excited to get these, and i loved them for a day, but then they kept breaking one after the other. if i left them on a cup for a long time (or sometimes just a short time), they would eventually just pop off at the seam. and now i feel bad that i'm tossing all this worthless plastic into the garbage where they will be leaching plastic yuckiness into the landfill for years to come. love the idea, but they are poorly made. skip them!!
"
2,"when i bought my blackberry, my battery lasted for 2 days of intensive use. it went like that for a full year and then in a matter of a week or two my battery life halved, i could only get a day out of it of not so quite an intensive use. i was delighted to see that amazon offered a new battery at what seemed a very attractive price, in comparison with what a cell store would charge. however, after using this battery that i purchased from amazon i get the same sort of medium sized day that i get with my old battery. this leads me to conclude that the vendor is recycling used batteries as new ones. it is cheap, but it is not new. if you don't have a battery at all get it. if you want to replace your old battery pay the $40 at a cell store and get the really new one.

2,"i use my blackberry 8300 world phone when i go to london, the battery had exploded and i was about to toss the phone until i discovered these. thank you.

2,"i recently upggraded from the 6120 to the 3360. the best thing that they did was increase the ringer volume. anyways i got the ear bud thing with it. i could barely understand what ppl were saying. it was horrible. it sounded as if you were in a can.
"
1,"dockers are dockers, so that's not the problem. just be sure you don't trust the images if you choose to buy these via amazon. ""cafe,"" for example, should be ""coffee."" despite the fact that the image for ""cafe"" shows a stone or very light gray color, ""cafe"" is actually dark brown. so the product isn't defective, but is misleading: i didn't want brown pants, but that's what i got.
"
2,"my initial impression was the sound quality was good but the workmanship was cheap. the cheapness was confirmed after about a month when the headphones stopped working and stopped taking a charge. additionally, when speaking with plantronics support i noticed a small crack on the union between the headband and the right earphone. now, these headphones were never dropped and handled delicated since day one due to the noticably cheap quality.on the positive side plantronics support seems first rate, the reason for the second star. plantronics must be well aware of the problem because they went straight to processing a return. they are shipping me out a new unit in advance of me sending the old pair back. a much appreciated cs touch. hopfully the new batch has these issues fixed
"
2,"i wanted the motorola razr for a while and i finally got one. now, i just wish i had my old phone back. here's why i don't like this phone:- buttons on the side are easy to accidentally push- the standard ringtones are terrible and you must pay for any new ones- the battery doesn't stay charged for more than a couple of days- frequently used functions are not very easily accessedoverall, i had high expectations for this phone. i thought i was getting this high tech, cool new device and it's not even as good as the simple three-year old phone i was using!

2,"when i opened the box and tried to pull the cable, it tangled right away. i tried to fix it, but to no avail.

2,"i bought this because i have a friend that has a similar unit that works well, but this one doesn't impress me at all. i very rarely use it because there's always at least a some static. i have tried numerous stations and even when i find one that seems to be working i have never made it through a whole song without a lot of interference.i will be buying a different transmitter!
"
2,"they never sent me one of the items i purchased. i am still waiting for it. now i just noticed that one of the items i bought from them that was supposed to be 16 x 20"" is much smaller.it has been more than a month after purchasing from them already.beware adam hersh

2,"don't loose the camera. difficult to replace with any kind of search and it's expensive. dumb not to have it built in...wish i had gotten the samsung that is similar to this one. i concur with most of the negative review. this in my only phone and i miss calls all the time.
"
2,"initially, this was the best fm transmitter i ever owned. my first one lasted 5 years before it stopped working (though it consumed two aaa batteries every month). the other worked fine, but the signal strength was relatively weak, and so there was a lot of background static. this one worked wonderfully. the audio was as clear as you can get with an fm transmitter, and i never had to worry about static.and then, after 3 months of owning it, the connection between the car plug and the transmitter itself basically stopped functioning. if i wiggled the wire around a bit, the transmitter would power up, but only for a few seconds. the only way i could get it to stay on was by putting constant pressure on the part of the wire that touched the transmitter. even then, it eventually stopped responding even to that. now it does not function at all.if you are willing to take the risk that the transmitter will work properly for as long as you want it, then this is a great product. but if durability is important, you might want to find a different fm transmitter.
"
2,"i expected this to have a pocket on the inside as mentioned in several of the reviews. also there is logo on the outside which is also unexpected based on the picture.

1,"great shirt in most respects, but way too small. i bought the adult small for my 12-year-old son, who is 5 ft even, 115 lbs, and it is so skin-tight he could barely breathe in it. i'm exchanging it for the non-compression version.
"
2,"in a nutshell: verizon has made this phone mediocre. if you gotta have a v3m, get one from another carrier.the razr v3m's sharp looks, respectable battery life and fidelity are marred by verizon's sluggish interface and crippled features. if all you want is a thin profiled phone, then you'll probably be happy with this item - and many places offer them up for free. but those searching for a ""media"" rich phone should keep looking.the ""in"" calling feature can save you a bundle if friends and family are verizon subscribers. but...if you are at all interested in customizing the v3m with ringtones, wallpaper and such, be prepared to hand fistfulls of cash to the vcast service or spend oodles of time trolling the net for info on hacks (of which there are plenty - for windows users).the built-in camera is just okay. with the placement of the lens near the hinge you're bound to end up with an index finger in many a shot. the same holds true for the video camera feature - not that you'll use it much since its record time is limited to 15 seconds.you can playback .wma files stored on a transflash card (that's next to the battery that must be removed to access the card) but there's no 3.5mm headphone port; a usb dongle adapter is in box. note: the largest card you can use is a 1gb.no usb cable is included despite the v3m's disabled obex feature (which allows the transferring of files via bluetooth). razrs from sprint, t-mobile, cingular an all-tell have this feature intact!pros:compact sizerespectable sound qualitycan check voicemail from another phonecons:many important wireless functions disabled!

2,"i was very disappointed with the earglove. it looked so cool with the interchangeable foam covers and all, but i just couldn't get it to work for me. the build quality left a lot to be desired, and after several attempts to fit it comfortably, it sort of came apart, although i managed to get it together again. then i just couldn't get the earbud thing to fit in my ear; if i stuck it right in it was very painful, as it's not padded, and if i positioned it hovering outside my earhole, i could hardly hear a thing, especially when the car was moving. i had much better luck with a competitor earpiece which looped right around my ear, and had a broader speaker cover which sat outside my earhole and gave plenty of volume. another irritating thing about the earglove was the mute button, which if your phone is not compatible cuts off the call instead.i don't want to be too harsh since i think with these ear-thingies its just a case of finding one which fits the shape and size of your ear best. maybe the earglove would work well for you. its just a shame you have to buy one to find out. maybe a friend has one you could try for size first, because if it doesn't fit it will be useless.
"
2,"i just realized that i have the s710 not the s710 vox. everything else remains the same.i have never written a review but i hate this phone so much i had to write it, i take care of my electronics and i am so angry that i have this phone. i bought this phone about 5 months ago. let me list the reasons why this phone is the worst tech investment ever:1. sometimes my mail downloads, sometimes not.2. when it does download, sometimes the whole message downloads, sometimes it downloads partially although my settings are for the full message.3. and now i am getting an error message about low storage space that pops up every few minutes even though i have deleted almost everything on the phone.4. this phone is a power hog! one minute its fully charged, the next hours, maybe not even a whole day it's dead. and i have power saving settings on.5. if you enter 3 numbers for the same contact, the name shows up 3 times, not just once w/ 3 numbers connected to it.6. i e-mailed htc tech help days ago about the memory alert and i have not gotten any response yet.and i know someone else who got a touchscreen htc at the same time that i got this phone. his touch screen already has stopped working. and he also takes care of his phone.i just want to trash this phone with a bat but it costs $400.00! although this phone has nice features, it is not easy to use and for the hassle that it is, it's not worth the money. htc is not ready for prime time! instead, get a blackberry, an i-phone, get a wire and two cups... anything else but an htc. or you'll be very sorry.

2,"hello all,don't buy this item....i bought it before two weeks and using it but never got good voice qulaity and even catching signal strength is also no good.i tried it in 5 diffrent state but it's not working.ther are may options or better product then this.and same quality product you can ger for $3-$4 from other sites.i am truly sugggesting you to not to buy this item.thanks
"
2,"i was disappointed in this case. it is, to me, a thin, cheap case. i would not have bought it if i had seen and felt it before.
"
2,"i had this phone for about 3 days and the flash light froze. i had to take the battery off to fix this. only for it to freeze again after trying the flashlight for yet a second time. it automatically deleted a couple of my contacts. i took it back & let verizon replace it with the same model only for the second model to not recieve all of my text msges & text pics. when i used blue tooth or a regular headphone my callers were unable to hear me. the camera is aweful. i understand that this is a phone good for durability & the bells & whistles aren't suppose to be great but the basics should at least work. i exchanged it for the chocolate lg 8550. so far so good.
"
2,"the squeem is a great idea, but their quality is second rate, and their customer service is worse than useless. i'd owned mine for about 4 weeks and worn it only a few hours a day when i noticed that a seam was coming unstitched. the threads aren't frayed; they're unstitching from the seam.contacting customer service has been an exercise in futility. they've asked for pictures of the damage, and then failed to respond to the pictures, or any further attempts to contact them.for what this costs, it needs to last longer than 4 weeks.
"
2,"i really tried to do my research before i purchased this phone, but unfortunately most of the available reviews were short term users. i was already expecting below-average battery life and a sub par camera, but the benefits i was expecting outweighed these concerns for me. the major problems began to creep in with more use.there are several good points to the phone. it really is a good-looking and well-built phone, and it just ""feels right."" the sound quality is excellent for both calls and music (assuming you have a stereo headset), and even the bluetooth headset sound quality is head and shoulders above my old motorola. the audio player is aac/m4a capable. the resolution of both lcds is great. nokia pc suite can sync the phone's calendar with lotus notes, a rare feature. i appreciate the release button more than i thought i would. i'm sure i'll miss that if my next phone doesn't have it. the only problem with the release button is sometimes accidentally pushing it as you pull out the phone while receiving a call. if the phone is set to automatically answer when it opens, the release gets pushed accidentally, and it's a call you don't want to take at the moment, you're stuck holding the phone closed until it stops ringing. still a nice feature.moving on to the phone's problems: one might assume that the combination of bluetooth and stereo mp3 playback on a phone would imply that the a2dp (stereo) bluetooth profile is supported. apparently, one would be wrong. admittedly, i probably should have assumed no specific mention of a2dp implied that the phone does not support it, but it doesn't help that searching the internet yields mixed results on the issue, and even nokia tech support still can't tell me one way or the other. as i can't get it to work with an a2dp gateway, it's probably safe to assume at this point that it doesn't support the profile.the rest of the problems stem from the outdated series 40 operating system and the phone's music functionality. the music player has been tacked on as an afterthought, which has severely overextended the capabilities of the os. first, the music controls are very cumbersome, using a cursor system to activate on-screen buttons rather than using the phone's keypad for controls. track numbers may be entered manually in the main player view but not in the playlist view.the phone has apparently not been tested with ""large"" music libraries. i purchased a 2gb microsd card soon after the phone, ready to load it up with music. however, the music transfer application included with nokia pc suite develops problems when trying to read a library of anything over 2000 songs or so. the main issue is that the database of meta tags breaks around that point. nokia tech support informed me that their test libraries are all around 1000 files or under. however, i'm sure i'm not alone in having a library of around 10,000 tracks or more these days. fortunately, you can load music files manually through either data transfer mode on the phone, or directly to the card.the problems don't end with the pc software, though. the phone does not organize tracks by subfolders; all tracks within the main music folder and all its subfolders are loaded into one huge playlist. for more specific selection, you either have to use the clumsy folder navigation interface and constantly reselect the main music folder, or you must manually create playlists with the music transfer software, which is time consuming and problematic with the issues i mentioned above. i plan to experiment with generic m3u playlists, but i don't have high hopes. and it gets worse: after filling up my 2gb card and manually creating a playlist for every album, which was 77 in total, attempting to change playlists now completely crashes the phone. it restarts and then reloads the entire library. for now, i'm navigating the huge playlist by guessing at track numbers, although you can only enter three digits. it's almost humorous what happens after track 999: the phone increments the first 9 to 10, so you see track 10 000 (except the last digit is partially cut off). at track 1100, you see 10 100 in the list.it has begun to feel like i'm beta testing the software in this phone, even though i paid for it and signed my life away for another two years to get it. it has crashed more than ten times in the three months i've had it. i especially felt like a beta tester when nokia tech support had me carry out experiments with my large music library and report back. i'm still hoping for a major firmware update, but i'm not holding my breath. frankly, they just don't seem that interested in working out the kinks in this mid-market phone with its outdated software components.i'd still recommend this phone if you don't have a large music collection and only want to use the music player very occasionally. if you won't use the music player at all, please buy a cheaper phone that doesn't have it. if you have a large collection and plan to use it regularly, as in my situation, i'd highly recommend spending a little more for something with at least the series 60 os, if you buy a nokia.
"
2,"bluetooth is cool, but this phone freezes up, randomly shuts down, and the camera sucks. too bad because the display is really terrific.
"
2,"i got this for 4.99 from a private seller not amazon. this things ancient and weighs 5 pounds. i thought of buying more and connecting them all to a bar to make a homeade weight lol. i will always go amazon.com from now on. i click on the seller amazon.con b4 i ever buy anything now after this. oh and amazon refunded me...not the seller. freakn thing turns your phone or tablet off when u plug it in...bad buy.
"
2,"i paid [a dollar amount over twice what amazon's charging, but that they'll delete if i put it here] for one at [a store the name of which amazon will delete, but if you had a battery club card when you were a kid like i did, you've been there] when they were pretty much the only place to get one. over the years i've tried headsets from at&t;, body glove, hello direct, jabra, and plantronics, and i find the bluespoon's soft spring to be the most secure and most comfortable method of fitting a headset to my ear (for that matter, jabra headsets won't stay in my ear for more than seconds at a time, and plantronics makes the most hideously uncomfortable earpieces on earth).the soft spring does take a bit of getting used to, but that's true of anything that goes in your ear (and also somewhat true of the over-the-ear headsets as well). a good rule of thumb is to wear it for no more than half an hour the first day, and gradually increase the amount of time you wear it each day. it weighs so little that you really don't notice it after you've acclimated to having it in your ear, not just on it.once you've learned how to insert it, the process is quick and one-handed. i don't have any issues with inadvertent button presses (thumb behind the bottom button, middle finger at the tip, and index finger popping the spring into the curve of my ear). and once you've inserted it properly, it's plenty loud. i have to assume that people who say it isn't loud enough just haven't figured out how to insert it.i had trouble with it disconnecting repeatedly from my phone even though it had a full charge, and it turned out that the bluetooth connection in the phone had actually gone bad. the headset connected just fine to my computer, and the computer couldn't maintain a connection to the phone either. once i got the phone replaced that problem went away. so if you have connection problems, test the headset with another phone before you throw it away in disgust. it might just be your phone.i bought a second one from amazon because one of the buttons on my first one didn't survive the impact with the ground after the headset was knocked out of my ear -- i could turn the volume up, but not down. i've repaired that with my trusty soldering iron so now i have two that work. i've also bought one as a gift and recommended it to a friend who's very happy with his.pluses: extreme battery life; light weight; comfort; bluetooth 1.2 and handsfree profile support.minuses: not the highest build quality in the world; replacement springs are nearly impossible to find; if you drop it and the battery is knocked loose, it won't reconnect to your phone until you plug in a power source again; good luck remembering all the button combinations for the handsfree profile.a minus only on paper: no noise reduction. in my experience noise reduction isn't worth the loss of battery power and increase in weight. i'd rather have a lighter headset that goes longer between charges.
"
2,"i researched and ordered the nokia boom headset (hdb-5) for the nokia 2600, which was suppose to work for the nokia 2600. upon receiving it i was very disappointed because when i would plug it into my nokia 2600 it kept coming up with the message 'enhancement not supported'. i tried everything to get it to work (including taking it over to my cell phone store and asking them if i was doing something wrong). they couldn't even come up with an answer. you need to take the boom headset (hdb-5) off of the list of enhancements for the nokia 2600, because it does not work for that model. as you can see it gets a very low rating from me, since it didn't work for my cell phone. your list of enhancements is very misleading and right now i have no hands off device for my nokia 2600 because of your misleading list.
"
2,"this is my second logitech set. my 1st was a mobile freedom which its ear loop broke after 6 months. logitech replaced it with this one 12/06. now 2 weeks prior to one year the ear loop snapped off of this one. poor design which outweighs the otherwise very reasonable functionality of the device.called logitech and they are refunding my money, which is ok as i do not want another one!
"
2,"the new battery i purchased doesn't seem as good as the original one, it needs to be charged more frequently, although the price was low i think the quality is low too.
"
1,"i have bought dockers for years but these are cut smaller than they usually are. even with the ""stretch"" waist band they are tight. so much for an ""extra"" inch. beware. try these in a store before you buy.

1,"this is the first thing i've ever gotten from under armour. everyone on my football team has good luck with their products but mine seems to be defective. after one wash the logo starts cracking and the second time worn the logo starts peeling...wishing for a refund, bad luck i guess.
"
2,"yeah, go with a different phone. this one has been discontinued because it has so many promlems. i've had it for the past 8 months or so and i'm getting ready to trade it in for a new one for the third time.problems the phone often encounters:-end button stops working-randomly dropped calls-answer the phone to both the microphone and speaker not working-screen not working so you can't tell who's calling-dirt gets under the screen very easilyi'm sure there are more. it's not all bad, but you're much better off with another phone.
"
2,"hard to get on, makes the keys hard to push, but it does what it's supposed to, protect my pearl :)
"
2,"the battery doesn't last long. it is a chinese product and doesn't look like an original nokia battery. but that's what you get when you pay $3 including delivery! that's why i gave it 2 stars instead of 1.
"
1,"i did not expect this top to be skin tight. the other armour exercise shirt i have is a comfortable fit. it is partly my own fault because i did not realize the significance of &#34;compression&#34; fit.
"
2,"i purchased 2 of these. first of all, the product image is wrong, because the image on amazon clearly shows the blackberry logo, and the batteries i got are unmarked and with no logo or mention of the word blackberry.i could have gotten over that if the battery actually worked . . .the batteries are refurbished, and not new. (they were not sealed in plastic.) i put in the first battery, turned off my phone, and charged it overnight. the next day i unplugged it and carried the phone around as usual. by night (about 14 hours later), the battery was dead. note that i did not make a single phone call that day. the phone was on standby, and it died in 14 hours! my old battery was almost as good!anyway, i bought two of them, as i said. the second one seems to be holding its charge somewhat, but i can see that the battery life indicator is already down to 75% after 10 hours of zero usage (all on standby).as far as i'm concerned, i was cheated into thinking the following (neither of which are true):1 - i was buying an original blackberry product (note: i have complained about the image to amazon, so i expect they will take action on this soon)2 - i was buying a new batteryi paid about $10 in total for these two batteries, and my time is more valuable than repackaging these and sending them back. my guess is that the seller is counting on exactly this psychology--that most of us will get annoyed for a couple of hours, and then realize that its not worth the time or attention.well done, mr & mrs fake-battery-seller. you got my money, but it's worth the 10 bucks for me to know never to go near you guys again.
"
2,"this charger came packaged nicely, and i figured i would give it a try. the cord is super short and within 5 uses the zune connector part literally fell apart in my hands! there were pieces everywhere. i barely kept it working without the covering for the connector for about 2 more uses then the exposed wires snapped. :( very disappointed with this product. will not buy from this company again.
"
1,"do not buy these shirts, not worth the money, certainly not worth bill blass label, very poor style and stitching and fabric.
"
1,"i have big legs and legs on this were too big while the waist area too tight even though i followed the instructions. had to return it.
"
2,"my mom and i both tried this phone. my husband tried it in black. all three of us had problems both sending and receiving calls. half the time it didn't even register that we had missed a call. other times it took us directly to voicemail without alerting that caller that they were being called. tried sony's recommendations--downloading updates via a usb cable sony sent, and a new charger. tried at&t's recommendation to ""turn it off while you shower and then turn it back on afterwards so it can receive updates from the tower."" nothing helped. i guess you get what you pay for--this was the free phone offered by at&t when we set up our plan.
"
2,"i have all 4 of the channels this device is suppose to work with. it only worked on one channel 107.9, it was very faint with static. my car stereo volume was turned completely up, and my mp3 players volume turned completely up. not sure what the problem, but i suppose you get the value of the price you pay.
"
2,"i purchased this for my brother-in law in another state. none of the adapters worked, and we decided it would not be worth the postage to return it.
"
2,"i ordered the item according to the chart that was associated with the size and it ended up being to big. the item is also like it is made from rubber, but because i needed it for this weekend i don't know what i am going to do at this point.
"
2,"handles fall off with long use, they don't cook evenly. never buying faberware again.
"
1,"i purchased one of these shirts from sport check and paid $30 for it. it was comfortable and i had no problems with it until 1 day i noticed some white flakes on the front of it. when i tried to wipe them off i saw that it was the material that was flaking off in a perfect circle. the more i brushed the bigger the hole grew. now you can see through the center of my shirt like some nylon stockings, which looks pretty girly. for a $30 shirt i sure expected to get a lot more wear out of it.
"
2,"i can't think of anything to gush about with this phone. usually i like nokia's but have been disappointed in this one.the sound dips up and down while listening to a caller.the moving display on the front screen annoys me to no end and is difficult to read. it is a large screen on the front, yet only 10% of it is utilized. the time and number of missed calls etc moves up and down the screen. why?my only hope is that perhaps if i feel like reading the manual this can be customized.and the battery....it is constantly beeping at me because it needs to be recharged. it is ridiculous how poor the battery life is!basically, this is just a generic phone to me. i am struggling to find reasons that i like this phone over others. i can't think of a feature that makes it stand out above the rest.
"
2,"amazon rebate is a scam. i purchased this headset on 1/23/2007, and received it on 1/25/2007. however, the rebateshq site was not functioning on 1/25/2007. when it works the next day, it can not locate the offer number, nor could this rebate be located from the manufacture. if you click on the url link supplied by amazon rebate form, you will be able to find the offer by amazon order number, however, they will disconnect you in the next step saying 'session expired'. there is no way around, what a scam. it's a shame for amazon to squeeze the last penny out of its customers. it's $5.99, come on!
"
2,"i got suckered in with the original price and then how much you get back when you sign up for service.1. do not use t-mobile. nothing but problems and thier service range is horrible.2. i agree with the camera. it stinks.3. not taking the charge is annoying. sometimes i have to play with the phone for sometimes 20 minutes so i can charge it overnight.4. the phone is not durable at all and the screen turns all blue after opening the phone after it has been off the charger for an hour or so. the phone will not function right and i have to close it and wait for a few minutes for the phone to reset. my sister in laws does the same thing. the phone should not do this.overall, i should have chose a little more wisely and know why they are giving so much back when you purchase the phone.
"
2,"my boyfriend bought this phone for me from amazon and it was the worst idea ever! first, when i got the phone it couldn't be activated due to technical problems (due to amazon, not at&t;). i called amazon for assistance, and they forwarded me to their cell phone department who said 1) they didn't know what the problem was, 2) there was no one else that i could speak to, and 3) they would email (not call) me back. amazon gave me the run-around for over two weeks. finally, i took the phone into an at&t; store. they informed me that is was most definitely a refurbished phone. they also told me the reason there were so many problems activating the number is because the phone number belonged to someone else! i called amazon to discuss the fact they had sent me a refurbished phone when i had bought a new phone, and they did not have an answer. the very nice customer service representative said that he would have someone email me back (because the cell phone specialty department did not make any calls). it's been two weeks and i still do not have an explanation as to why i was sent a refurbished phone or why i was assigned a number which was already assigned to someone else.do not buy phones from amazon. although you pay less for the phone, it's not worth it!!! just go it the store and deal directly with the cell phone company.
"
2,"the product description on amazon's web page indicates that this headset is compatible with the nokia 2600 phone. so i ordered two of them together, but neither one worked with my nokia 2600. since the seller would only refund my purchase price and original shipping charges, i had to pay the return shipping costs myself. so i'm now back to square one with no headset for my phone -- and with less money in the bank than before. the only reason i'm giving this headset one star is because i wasn't able to proceed with my review unless i rated it at least one star!
"
2,"we received our comforter, and it was not the dimensions advertised. we contacted the seller(egyptian cotton factory outlet store) and the claimed manufacturer (warm things). the manufacturer responded quickly to tell us that this seller does not have access to their products. the seller has copied the language from the manufacturer's website and is selling fraudulent products in their name. if you care about the quality or dimensions of the comforter you're buying, don't buy from them.
"
2,"okay so i guess i didn't read the 1 or 2 reviews that said the case doesn't close shut.it clicks shut then flips open. anyway i will return what is essentially a pointless product now. very disappointed.seems the build quality is inconsistent as most reviews said it shut fine but 1 or 2 did report this problem
"
2,"this phone look good but don,t work when press number don,t work speakerphone dont workmake alot fuss drop call a lot this is a bad phone motorola have good phone don,t know what happen to this one if i could give back it would be gone
"
3,"i was given one of these sets as a gift. nothing like the farberware of 20 years ago. the original sets would last a lifetime, these appear cheaply made and nowhere near as substantial. i don't think they'll last. fit and finish not as good as the original farberware. another great american brand trashed by asian junk merchants. save your money and look for new old stock on ebay, but be sure to buy made in us only.
"
2,"i ordered a 16 piece place setting , service for 4 but only recieved a 4 piece place setting, service for 1. i contacted amazon and they arranged to have the order corrected and arrange for return for the incorrect order. once to corrected shipment arrived again it was a service for only 1. i was charged for a service for 4. this was eventually credited back to me however since i only had 2 place settings, i purchased 2 others locally at younker's department store. the dishes that came with from amazon are different than the ones from younker's. it is like the molds were different or something...the plates are deeper from amazon and as a result the set does not stack properly. i am not certain if this inventory issue has been resolved with amazon so buyer beware.

2,"this battery is recycled from the used cell phone. the power can not be hold even for one day.

"
3,"i have a rival mug warmer that i've enjoyed for years. no idea where i got it. i just know it's been a champ! recently, my husband was ill and wanted to use it for the broth or tea he was constantly sipping. he got better, i requested it back, he returned it, then stole it again two days later. so, time for me to get to get a new one, right?unfortunately, this mr. coffee warmer is no rival to my rival! my rival is so hot that the bottom several sips of coffee are almost (not quite) too hot to drink, and that's how i like it. on the few occasions i've forgotten about it, it's still hot hours and hours later, and there will have been some evaporation/concentration of the leftover coffee!the mr. coffee, on the other hand, lets the coffee cool to barely above tepid after a mere half hour. i deliberately left the bottom few sips for awhile, and even that last little bit got colder. this just is not acceptable. at all.oh, and to be very clear, for my test of this mug warmer, i was sure to use the same mug i always use for my coffee (so no difference in surface area contacting the warmer), i pre-warmed the mug to almost too-hot-to-touch, and i prewarmed the warmer itself for about two minutes before placing my piping-hot mug of coffee on it. with all that, for it to be tepid at the bottom in 30 minutes is just ridiculous.i just requested a refund, and was very pleased to be told by amazon that i wouldn't have to hassle with actually returning this thing in order to get said refund. my husband is going to see if it will be adequate for him, because he's actually fine with ""tepid"". (and i'll be taking back my rival warmer, thank you!) when i unplugged the mr. coffee warmer in order to give it to him, i noticed that the bottom of the thing was warmer than the warming plate itself. yeah. let's waste the heat out the bottom of it, rather than directing it to where it does the most good. *sigh*
"
2,"everytime the bass on the music went up the reception got very static. tried almost every station possible but had same result. i bought a $12 transmitter from amazon long time ago, it worked alot better than this item.
"
2,"i've now used this on two long car trips up and down the east coast, and my recommendation is that you only buy this if you are absolutely desperate to use your ipod in your car, and there are literally no alternative ways to use your car's audio equipment to accomplish that. the sound (whether in an urban area or way out in the sticks) is noisy, distorted, and compressed, even when there are no local interfering stations. loud music is crackly, quiet music is inaudible.
"
2,"save your money. the eargels split in two days. i used regular ear buds on the large size. they did hold the buds in the ear better, but no gain in sound quality. if you want the small and med, i'll send them to you for shipping. i have no use for them.

1,"i bought two shirts and later i realize never ever buy cloths over net. what you see is not what you get. these are poor quality shirts.
"
2,"i purchased two of these in june '01, and both were dead as a doornail by sept '01. i use an ericsson charger that doesn't allow overcharging and i conditioned the battery each month - which means that they were dead after the 3nd conditioning. neither would charge back up after they had been discharged. in fairness to ericsson, i have to say that their warranty service is superlative. they sent me upgrade replacement batteries, no shipping charges, within one week. ericsson gets five stars but this particular battery gets one.

2,"this is the worse phone i ever had. at the begining was ok but now after 4 month phone by itself start to get numbers even when i want to make off or on the phone and by press that buttom, phone by itself gets last no i got before!!!
"
2,"received case well packaged and fast shipping! the case itself form fits phone fine, but does not snap well together. the first time i tried one of the top tabs broke. so for temporary purposes until i get a new case i used a dab of gorilla glue to hold the upper two halves together. obviously if i have to reset the phone this will be the end of the case. only 3 bucks, but i would put that money towards a soft silicone case.
"
2,"i could not get a single station to play acceptably. returned this item after trying to go through every station without any positive results.
"
2,"none of them actually fit my ear or the other person i brought them for. they were way too big. if you have small ears don't purchase this item.

2,"i've been a palm fanatic for over 10 years. i've always been an early adopter and bought the latest gadget when it first came out. i agree with many of these reviewers that the treo 600 was a breakthrough product and has great functionality, etc. but it is completely unreliable. i'm currently on my 3rd 600. each one died a hideous death after about 6 months. first the normal phone speaker died. so handspring replaced it for free. six months later the monster buzzing in my ear made using the phone impossible (in addition it had a nasty problem of doing a hard reset all on its own about once a week - often when i was traveling.) so again handspring replaced it. about 4 months into my 3rd device the monster screeching buzzing returned. this time when i called for a new one i was informed by palm that, ""we don't replace phones for free any more. it will cost you $200 to get a replacement."" so basically palm's business model is: we sell you a product that consistenly doesn't work and then we demand that you pay us as much to replace it (with another one that doesn't work) as you would have to spend to get a blackberry. it's unbelieveable. so i thought i'd suck it up and buy the 650 (even though two different friends bought it and both had already swapped it out for the same unreliability). but palm told me to get a 650 would cost me $700 ! i said, ""wait a minute, handspring used to give me the new phone each time at a discount if i'd send my old one back."" but i was informed that palm doesn't reward loyalty in any way anymore. what a joke.so i wrote a letter to the ceo of palm to complain. that was 5 months ago. no response or acknowledgement. what a disappointing company - in every aspect of it.i now use a motorola razor. palm is a joke. no serious business person can rely on the palm products or the company any more. shame.

1,"great shirt in most respects, but way too small. i bought the adult small for my 12-year-old son, who is 5 ft even, 115 lbs, and it is so skin-tight he could barely breathe in it. i'm exchanging it for the non-compression version.
"
2,"the first one we received was dead out of the box. it made a loud grinding and sounded like a fan hitting metal. we assumed this was due to shipping damage and received a replacement. the replacement worked fine for six months but suddenly the display panel would go blank and the clock would reset after a few minutes. the microwave has now ceased functioning altogether. the warranty states ""in-home"" service, but there are no local service facilities.
"
2,"the manufacturer packed this product so poorly that the plastic joints between sections of the tree were smashed, and the pole in the center of the tree was bent beyond redemption. i have no idea how this tree looked all put together since i had to repack it and send it back. thankfully amazon.com's return policy is generous and swift - they get five stars for service! in the meantime, it was a real tree for me again this year . . . i may try to go with an artificial one next year, but will not order one online again.
"
2,"h.j spivack's review (12/17/04) is dead-on! i have experienced the same issues and frustration with cingular & this phone. my advice, get a different phone & service. received the first phone in june 2004 and now in may 2005, i am on the fifth phone. each time a problem has come up (buttons didn't work, display stops working, phone answered the call on its own (while sitting on the desktop), etc.), the service has been tremendously awful (1 hr on the phone) and my only viable option is to receive another refurbished phone. the company tells me the replacements are ""reconditioned"" and suggested i contact motorolla. even after clearly articulating i was dissatified with the quality of the phone and service, my request for a refund and/or different phone at their cost was denied. this company is not customer friendly or interested in maintaining any level of customer service or satisfaction. add to that poor phone performance and it is a lose-lose scenario.
"
2,"i am using this phone for the past one month. though i read all the reviews about this phone i didnt think that sony ericsson could make such a bad phone. agreed...it has all the features compiled in it...but what is the use of the phone if it doesnt have a good reception. (this is the worst of the phones in reception i have ever used). people might comeback and say reception is because of the area am in, but i checked with other nokia and samsung phones(of same service provider) in the same spot.my guy was the worst.not just that, this feature packed phone is not able to stand the load of all the features. it just hangs and the only way out is to turn off and turn on the phone. this would be the worst thing you would ever like to do when you are in the mid of a call or searching for a number.the features might look tempting. but i would seriously advise anyone to think twice before buying this piece. i was totally disappointed by the quality of the phone. ( i am not writing this in a day or a week, i have used this phone for around a month).
"
3,"i don't know if i'm the only one that experienced this problem but i ordered the blue floral paisley set and got some ugly checkered blue design. looks like a little kids room sheet. i emailed amazon and they resend another sheet set that looks exactly the same as the wrong one i received before! i'm giving the item poor ratings because amazon gives you something that's not even shown on the screen (nor in any of the other options that are even sold out). i'm not even sure what they're shipping out, but it's not what's described on the page. if you have this problem, please email amazon, so i'm not the only one with this complaint. thanks.
"
2,"i've had this phone for under a year. it has some great features for sure! i really liked the pink color and i am over 30. from the begining, everyone i spoke to on the phone said they could not hear me unless i spoke loudly into the bottom of the phone which was quite annoying esspecially in public. then one day no one could hear me at all. i tried everything including reseting the phone, nothing worked. i am now in the market for a new phone in less than a year, what a waste.
"
2,"i really wanted this item to work because everybody seemed to love it. it didn't hold anything in on me and it gave me back boobs. waste of money for me.
"
2,"we were given this product as a gift and absolutely loved them at first. they are compact (compared to many grinders) and a cute design. unfortunately we found the first flaw a few weeks later when it came time to refill for the first time. the refill doors are tiny! the only reasonable way to pour in salt was to use a paper funnel and the pepper was even worse having to be fed one peppercorn at a time through the tiny door.after the second refill the little doors started refusing to stay shut. since they slide ""up"" to close with the way the mills sit on the shelf. they just fall down and constantly reopen with the help of gravity even when not used.we used these mills at most for 3 meals a week...2 people who aren't heavy spicers, but despite our limited use of these mills the handles broke off in under 11 months.it's a cute product if you are ok with something that is designed to not be used beyond 2-3 refills.
"
2,"this seems not to work. it says the led should light, but it doesn't. my cell phone was not completely out of charge when i started, so i couldn't tell. i tried emailing the manufacturer at the address on the directions, but the email bounced.
"
1,"i agree, these are cut small... buy an inch or two larger than you normally do. the waist band does not stretch.
"
2,"i replaced an old betty crocker warmer due to age (20 years) with this, ironically because i thought i may be pushing my luck with ancient wiring. the first time out of the gate, i left the house with the warmer on for hours...the on/off indicator light is so dim i can only see the glow if i cup my hand over the light to shade it. scared me enough to pull my old one back out, it has an automatic shutoff that would have prevented my potentially dangerous oversight. and warms better anyway!
"
2,"i am enjoying its use. the only issue is one of manufacturing. the opening that allows for moving of the vibrate off/on control does not align with the control. it is difficult to move the control. i modified the case by making a small cut to it.
"
2,"i just got this phone a few days ago to replace my broken sonyericsson z520a. i'm attracted to this samsung because of the thin form factor and pretty impressive spec.but the first time i used it, i was totally disappointed. my biggest complaint is the flat keypad. the keypad doesn't give you enough tactile feedback when you press it. and for some reasons some keys are harder to press than the others. this really annoys me since i text message a lot.other than the keypad, this is a very nice phone. the screen is high resolution (320 x 240) and very bright. imho the user interface is not as intuitive as sony ericsson's.i tried bluetooth on this phone and was able to transfer my phonebook from my laptop without a hitch.but for me, the keypad is the killer. that's the reason i rated it 2 stars. this phone is going back to amazon for sure.
"
1,"i did not get the slack that had the waistband. i got slack with no waistband, so i send them back an was trying to ge a 42 29 but i received a e mail stateting that the product was no longer avability. so far i'am not sure were my refund went. please let me know.tom atkinson
"
2,"let's start with the bad things:1: there's no way this battery will ever give 2 weeks of standby time in the real world. when i first got it, about 7 months ago, it would give 5-6 days. not bad, but a far cry from the ""1-2 weeks"" that was promised.2: it decays fast. 7 months ago i could get 5-6 days of standby time. this battery has now been reduced to being 1-2 days. the ""zero memory effect"" claim is also worthless.personally, i'd avoid the sch-3500 at all costs. while it seems like it should be a decent phone, it has a myriad of problems. i'm currently on my second, the first one died after less than a year of very light use. pick a different phone and battery system.
"
1,"i bought two shirts and later i realize never ever buy cloths over net. what you see is not what you get. these are poor quality shirts.
"
2,"charger connection to bluetooth is poor. it does not connect well and sometimes looses connection which causes poor charge performance.
"
2,"charging end would not seat securely in phone socket. tip broke off within a month of purchase. i should know better by now.
"
1,"merchant was out of stock on the second pair of pants, so when it was shipped i was charged $9 again when the second pair was in stock weeks later.will not buy from amazon vendors again.
"
1,"i ordered several designs of the cacharel shirts and was very disappointed when they arrived because the fabric was extremely thin. i always wear a white undershirt, and that fact was very evident since one could literally see through the shirt.
"
2,"like most cell phone users, i had two chargers for my phone: the supplied wall-wart charging transformer, and the accessory mobile charging cord. the wall wart rarely got used- i'd have to find it, unroll the cord, reach down to plug it into the wall, etc. not a very handy device. the mobile charger was much more convenient- if i remembered to use it, and if it was in the car i was driving. oops, left the charger in the van. oops, forgot to connect it. more than once i arrived at the office with a nearly dead phone.i bought this little stand on a whim, really, but it's turned out to be the single most useful accessory i ever purchased for a cell phone. now, when i come home, i immediately drop the phone in the charging stand at my desk. when i leave the house, i grab the phone and it's always fully charged. i haven't used the mobile charging cord since buying this stand. i haven't had to.
"
2,"doesn't really work in a major city. the radio installation company in my neighborhood said if you have a hidden antenna in your car that this device can cause damage to your radio too. not worth the $$ play more cd's...

"
2,"came in 100% static all the time on every station. could barely tell what song i was trying to listen to. needless to say i sent it back the day after i received it. it's too bad because i've had one of these before and it worked great for years. this one may have been a dud.
"
2,"horrible product!! waste of money, do not even waste ur time! i live in an area with numerous dead channels with other older transmitters working perfectly well ... this one is all static and a complete failure.
"
3,"i have had a white one for years and very happy with it. however, i purchased two new mugs that were larger on the bottom than my other mugs. i looked at the black warmers and the photo appeared larger than the white one. also, the dimensions state a larger size. it is not. the burner is exactly the same size as the white one.
"
2,"i would advise any potential purchasers to avoid this product. mine worked once, and hasn't worked since. this is not a quality product.
"
2,"i've had this phone for 8 months and since then palm had replaced my treo 600 4 times. i've never dropped nor scratched it but it's just the phone itself that's messed up. every now and then there's a problem with this phone but i will still keep it coz i paid so much on this cr*p.for those of you who are thinking of getting a palmone treo 600, think over 100 times first okay?!honeybeechicago, il
"
3,"if you thought that farberware made good quality cookware, you are wrong. they used to. but now they've cut corners and are creating such low quality cookware that it's actually a safety issue. and just try to contact customer support, feedback, or even try and find the president of the company! you'll find ""shell corportations""/licensing companies and tons of complaints on various state departments of consumer affairs websites.i tried contacting them to report a serious problem with the new cookware that i've added to my collection (a 9 3/4"" fry pan & a 6 3/4"" sauce pot). on both the part where the handle connects to the metal cookware is now manufactured half as deep as their older products. the screw holding them together loosens up with just a single use. you'll need to keep a phillips head screwdriver at the ready to tighten the handle each time you use the pot!!! without putting too fine a point on it, please note that the pot -by definition- usually contains scalding hot liquids, so you sure don't want an extremely wobbly handle while you're using the cookware!!i tried to contact farberware to report this, and to see if they had a ""work around"" in place, like maybe longer screws! farberware's own website is so obstructive, and impossible to use that it can only be a deliberate attempt to disavow product warranties and to wall themselves off from actual customer feedback. you find yourself in a loop that does not allow input. and there is no other way on their site to contact them except by clicking on the ""contact us"" which only sends you annoying emails back with non-functional links! doing d&b; research i found that the current holder of the farberware license is meyer corporation u.s. and their president's name, so i'm going to follow up with post mail.but i first wanted to warn you! i've always found amazon's product reviews to be extremely helpful and have positively guided a lot of my own buying decisions. unfortunately, i had not checked product reviews before buying the two new pots because of my prior good experience with the quality of farberware products. so live and learn. i've also learned that true high quality alternatives to farberware are creuset, lodge, and the dutch oven from the mario battlia line. avoid farberware like the plague! -alana
"
2,"too big for my car. the microphone is way too big and hard to install. i will prefer a headset next time. note: the size of this car kit is just like a fist. before you buy it, remember to check your car by placing your fist near the car plug and try whether it will stick your car transmission or not.
"
3,"got a replacement, and new unit works great! - amazon won't let me change stars, but i'd change to 4.5 if i could.!i purchased this after reading the reviews. i had no desire to use this for a party or large gathering, just one serving at a time ( 4-8 dogs). i tried it the day after it arrived and once since. the heating coils turn warm, but they don't warm up enough to prevent touching them after an hour on max heat. we tried two batches, after 1 hour the dogs were warm, more than room temp, but thats it. called the company, they said to return to amazon, we probably have a defective unit.
"
3,"purchased this in 2010. doesn't keep coffee warm. well, barely warm -- but significantly cooler than i'd like. my preference is a cup that is almost as warm as when it is first poured -- not crazy hot, but more than lukewarm. this isn't even close. and don't even think that it can warm up a cup that has started to cool because you've been carrying it around for a few minutes.
"
2,"this device worked for less than a week, then the power began phasing inexplicably and the device no longer functions.
"
2,"i can't charge the cell phone battery. i even took it to sprint, to see if they could charge it. nothing happen. i was told that the machine could not identify the battery. what a dispointment.
"
2,"it does protect your phone but it started cracking after only having it for two weeks so if you plan on it being used every day plan on replacing it soon.
"
1,"i have worn jobst compression hose for a few years now. i havenever had a problem. i was thrilled when i had the option fora sheer pair....great for summer. the third time i wore one pair,i got a hole in them. i am not even sure how that happened. i figuredi must have done something. i put on my backup pair and the first timei wore them i developed a hole in them...the same leg (right one). nowthat i see these posts i know i will never purchase them again.
"
2,"many bubbles in casing...phone keeps demanding i install a sim card that was not received...best of all, the charger is european, not american...co. rep has offered to work with these ""issues"" but i do not expect them to repay the time and $30.00 it cost to replace the charger, and i do not have the time to waste trading the phone for one that is not marred.
"
2,"-they hadn't designed it to attach to your phone with a coiled wire. why not just a shorter straight wire? i wanted a retractable thing so that i wouldn't have to fight with the wire anymore. i'm still fighting it.-it weren't as big as my phone-the earbud weren't so delicate. the only reason i'm still using it is because, after the first one i bought utterly failed after about 10 minutes of use... and i argued with customer service for an hour or two, sent it back to nokia, and demanded my money back... they then sent me a new one. this one still works after a year... but i'm careful with it when i argue with the wire.
"
2,"great concept, i've had a palm pda since the first palm pilot personal then professional then a 7 and then the i version for internet with palm.net. i love the palm apps calendar and contacts, but this phone that cost $500 started to give me problems right after the year warranty time period. (which just so happened to coinside with the katrina catastrophe when our phones weren't working anyway due to service problems). the problem still continues with the same as the other reviewer mentions with this loud buzzing on the receiver side of the phone call. it's terrible and not usable this way. i'm afraid to send it for repair based on what another reviewer said that he got a refurbised model that was in worse shape than his and then after a few months had serious problems. the repaired phones are only warranted for 90 days, not long enough for these problems to show up. palm should be ashamed of themselves for not providing better support for such expensive phones!!! i bought mine unlocked directly from palm as well.
"
2,"this is an amazon scam! the clip is not for the v60 or v60i phones. there is no way you can mount your phone on the clip.the box claims the clip is for the l7082, l7089 and 120 phones.so amazon gets your money, you get a usless clip that would cost you more to return, than it cost to buy. nice little scam.i wonder do they ever read these reviews. i wish i had, i took them at their word.
"
2,"i originally purchased the logitech mobile freedom headset but when the clip that goes behind your ear broke, logitech exchanged it for the mobile traveller.unfortunately, this one is not comfortable at all. i agree with others that after 30-45 minutes, it feels like your ear is in a vise. it's true. it hurts.sound quality is very good. people say they can hear me just fine, and i can hear them just fine.but it also disconnects with my cell phone when it is not in use. what good is that? then when the phone rings, i don't hear it.then the clip broke on this one as well. logitech again replaced it. but how long will this one lsat?do yourself a favor and skip this one.
"
3,"i am a little disappointed in the quality of the stainless on this product. i have an older 1 oz. version of this and it is really nice. the stainless looks like it is about to get rusty at any time if i don't dry it immediately and thoroughly after every use. compared to my little one, the shine factor is just not even there. i regret not buying one of these about 15 years ago when i got my small one.
"
3,"is there anything worse than to be up at 5am with your infant, waiting for your morning coffee to brew only to find it all over the counter, cabinets and floor! what's worse than having to clean an enormous, scalding hot mess?--> having to do it first thing in the morning before your coffee!!!i've owned this coffee maker for a year.... found out about this 'little' design flaw early on. i know how to align and check everything and this still periodically happens. nearly every time we have houseguests, if someone else makes the coffee, it happens to them...poor things. anyhow, there's gotta be a better machine out there and i will find it..i'm not drinking my a.m. coffee at 3pm so this machine is not worth the gigantic pain in the a$$ of cleaning the mess!
"
2,"i am not happy with this item. it will not hold the station and has a lot of static. therefore, music does not play correctly.very disappointed.
"
2,"this phone is super-locked, means can be used with only active sim card. i purchased this phone as standby and for travel purpose. you can not used camera or fm radio without active sim card. i have several locked old phone, both gsm and cdma. i can use camera, music player, fm etc without any sim card or active service. i tried installing my old inactive sim card, but this phone is not accepting it. and without active sim card it will not turn on. i can get better and free phone with service.
"
1,"this was a gift, but the fabric was cheap and didn't look great on or last well. however it was fun, and i got compliments on it all night.
"
2,"i ordered this product and received it within the specified amount of time. however, when i opened the package the item i received was not the one that i ordered. it was a completely different item then i ordered.it wasn't even similar. the bluetooth i received was black and silver. i was very disappointed.needles to say i was going to keep it after to calling the number on my shipping paper. i opened the package and the bluetooth did not even work!!!!!!!!!! i returned the item and received my money back but i still spent money to send the item back and never got a shipping label from the company when i asked for one. very displeased.
