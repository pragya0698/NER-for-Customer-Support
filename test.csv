"headset,phone,hear,compared","PRODUCT,PRODUCT,PRODUCT,PRODUCT","this headset has a major flaw - the connections between the headset and phone are full of static. the other parties don't hear it, but their voice is constantly zapped by the static, and i'm asking them to repeat themselves. i've compared it with a couple other headsets i've got, and they don't have this problem in the same locations. actually, this headset has static problems anywhere - office, car, out walking, you name it.do yourself a favor and avoid this one.

"phone,hear,blue","PRODUCT,PRODUCT,INFO","i was disappointed that when i would dial digits on my phone i could always hear static in the blue tooth. then the unit would not hold a charge. i sent an e-mail to the address listed for the company on the amazon website and it has been over a week and no one has responded. i finally ended up calling the manufacturer and they said that if i filled out some paperwork, they would replace it. i assume this will happen this week.

top,PRODUCT,"purchased this screen last week and it came with noticeable scrapes across the top. the box it came in was gigantic with plenty of packaging material, but the screen was packaged loosely at the bottom. however, since it was in another smaller box, i'm thinking that the scraping was there to begin with, and not from shipping. still deciding whether to go through the trouble of exchanging it since another reviewer said they had the same damage. i wouldn't want to risk getting another with the same damage and i really need a screen right now. other than the damage, it's a very nice screen.

"pan,cookware","PRODUCT,PRODUCT","i bought the farberware 13 piece set after reading previews from other customers, with great hopes that i will get good performance. unfortunately, on the first use itself, the 2 qt sauce pans were permanently tainted so that the inside and outside walls have a warped look as though the steel is burnt and the metal has lost its shape. very difficult to describe unless i post a picture of the pan along with this review. overall, i feel very disapponted with the quality of this cookware. looks like i will have to shell out hundreds of dollars to buy the more expensive brands such as calphalon or all-clad.

phone,PRODUCT,"when i first got this phone i was very excited about it, but now i am ready to bail out from t-mobile and get a different phone and plan.1) the coverage is lousy. as soon as you leave a metro area, you lose coverage. there seems to be no roaming option with t-mobile, unlike other phone companies.2) the phone is an interesting toy, but the camera is unwieldy and doesn't work very well. the pictures are dim, blurry, and the screen has poor resolution. altogether a disappointing experience.

"large,small","INFO,INFO","my step-daughter got a set of glasses, and 3 family members cut themselves because they broke as they were washing them. i thought i'd replace her [poorly made] and dangerous ones with these, due to what i thought of as the quality name brand anchor hocking. she already got a different set of glasses, so i kept them for myself. one was broken in the box when i opened them up. i thought no big deal. i started using them, and within a month, of the 16 total, i am down to only one large one and four small ones. i also have 2 less butterfly stitches and 6 less bandaids in my cabinet. my daughter informed me that these were the exact glasses she experienced the same problems with. i am sorry to discover that anchor hocking is no longer going to be associated with quality, as it used to be in the past.

"phone,windows,sony,cable","PRODUCT,BRAND,BRAND,PRODUCT","well, it technically does what it is supposed to do--that is, allows you to transfer files from your phone to your computer or vice versa. but, it is rude & puts up a fight to do so. the thing came with no instructions, so it took forever to install. once installed, it creates a desktop icon which can't be removed or modified...because it's not actually a desktop icon (when i figure out what exactly this thing is, i'll post it) or in the registry at all. actual transfer of files takes over the entire computer (don't have anything else running) and is slower than a floppy drive! i've found a ton of settings and such that the software changed without asking (rude in my book), so i'm probably going to have to re-install windows to get everything back the way i like it. although, it's nice to have the pics off my phone to email and have a custom wallpaper & ringtones on my phone, i'm really thinking of returning this rude little punk. if i could, i'd give it zero stars.(i'm not 100% sure that this will make a difference since the main problem appears to be sony's software that you download from them, but the cable appears to be made by someone other than sony and the oficial sony data cable is pretty much only sold through sony's website.)update on 6/4/2006:i was given a data cable for my sony ericsson z500a as a gift (turned out to be a 3rd party cable like this product is). at first, i was happy that i'd be able to transfer pictures taken with my camera phone to my computer to email to friends back home...but after installing everything, the thing only worked a few times at a nerve-rackingly slow pace. after tons of headaches messing with that, i contacted sony's tech support. they don't seem to know how to figure out problems very well, and about all they could do on that call was get my info to send out a new cable. the new cable (sony ericsson cable) doesn't seem to work either, and i've called them several times now--each time speaking with 2-3 reps.so, my advice would be to not bother with the data cable (third party or sony's) since neither will work properly. if you have a third party cable such as this product, don't tell sony tech support because then they won't help you, so you're basically just out the money you spent on a cheap unofficial cable. just enjoy your sony ericsson z500a & watch anyone who has a camera phone that has a working data cable for ideas for your next phone.

phone,PRODUCT,"the phone description says it is a quad band phone, but the one i received was tri-band (900/1800/1900). this international version does not work everywhere i need it to work. i have at&t service (3g) and it works in nyc, where i work, but it did not work in upstate ny. the network in upstate ny switches from 3g to edge. if it had 850 band, it would have worked. the phone itself is a decent phone, but if doesn't work, it doesn't matter. amazon's description is not accurate, so if you need a quad band phone beware of this phone. you might be better off getting a us version instead.

"phone,battery,motorola,samsung,compared,stop","PRODUCT,PRODUCT,BRAND,BRAND,PRODUCT,PRODUCT","i had this phone for three days before rushing to return it. i love the look and feel of the phone as well as the keypad. all wonderful. don't get me started on the 2mp camera with ""flash."" great! i also love that you cannot overcharge the battery as well as the feature where if you can't get to the phone right away, a message will tell the caller to hold on a sec. one of the reasons i returned it is the alarm. you have to set it every night! i have friends with motorola phones and their phones had the multi-alarm feature where you can set it by day, etc. why doesn't this phone have that? another thing that got on my nerves was the ui. samsung has spoilt me with their numbered menus. pressin' the down key nine times to get to the 9th menu option when i can just press the no. 9 key just doesn't make sense to me in this day and age. the speaker phone isn't loud enough either. hey, if i didn't take enough time to get to know the phone and i'm wrong about any of this, please lemme know. i opted for a samsung blast. looooove it! got my numbered menus and the ""flash"" on the motorola rizr z3 is nothing compared to all the frames, clip art and other fun stuff you can do with samsung's camera options. still i can't stop thinkin' about the rizr z3. however, when i get past its looks, the romance is done.

"cover,small","PRODUCT,INFO","i don't like the plastic belt clip but the clear cover is all i wanted anyway. by the way, you can take the plastic knob off. you just need a really small screw driver (like the kind you use to fix your glasses). the first day i put it on my pearl, i dropped it. not even a scratch on the cover. and for an unexpected bonus, the indicator light reflects off the clear plastic to make it easier to see if i have any messages or alerts.

"dress,shirt,red","PRODUCT,PRODUCT,INFO","i bought 6 of these shirts going by the photographs and some of the reviews. dont mean to be rude, but people who gave these shirts probably haven't wore a decent dress shirt. you can frequently get 'good' $45 shirt for $10 in malls when on sale. i thought this was a better deal. but boy oh boy, i can assure you this is not much better than what you might get at a dollar store. i had ordered these as a gift, but now will give them to red cross because these should not be worn at any kind of formal occassion, or even for daily use (except maybe when you are working at septic tanks or something). these are from bangladesh, and i can assure you, they are not much better than what would be sold for $0.50 in bgd. if you have any self-respect and work in anything but a lowest income group atmosphere, do not buy these shirts.

"coffee,warmer,young,mug,hear,black","PRODUCT,PRODUCT,BRAND,PRODUCT,PRODUCT,INFO","so i love coffee. i drink it all the time. morning, noon, night i can never get enough. with a habit like this it doesn't take long for people you know and love to start calling you things like ""mr. cup of joe' or ""coffee head"". the list goes on and on, and some are cute ...others not so much. i never really thought that i would need a coffee warmer, as i stated before i drink it all the time so it never gets cold. well last year around the holidays my office decided to have a party. some genius came up with the idea to have a secret santa event. for those who don't know what that means, you basically draw a name out of a hat and then buy a present for that person. i wasn't big on the idea; i don't really care for most people in my office. they are either too young, too dumb, or both to not get on my nerves. i can be a bit irritable at times as a side effect for my caffeine addiction. anyway, i lucked out and i drew the name of this young intern we have in the office. what a knock out. every guy we had working wanted her, lucky for me she wanted nothing to do with them, and i ended up making her my mistress. so drawing her name for the secret santa was pretty much like winning the lottery. i was trying to figure out how i could buy her a present without my wife getting wise to the affair. so this was like killing two birds with one stone. what i didn't realize was that the whole thing was rigged and she set it up for me to draw her name, and surprise, she drew mine. so i start racking by brain trying to figure out what i am going to get this dame for a present. i was stuck between a sleek nightgown, and a pair of leather chaps that came with a free ball gag (if you don't know what that is, watch the movie pulp fiction, they put one in the colored fella's mouth before they have their way with him). i ended up going with the night gown. like i originally suspected, my wife was suspicious of the present when i handed it to her and told her to wrap it up. once i told her it was for the office intern she looked like she wanted to say something else, but i quickly shut her down.so the night of the party we are all sitting around a circle exchanging gifts. at this point i had quite a bit to drink; next to coffee my favorite drink is jim beam. i wasn't in the mood for any smart aleck remarks. well it gets to be the interns turn to open her gift. everyone is taken back immediately when she pulled out the nighty. it was as if they all knew our dirty little secret. i could see it in all of their eyes, and i was just waiting for one of them to have the nerve to say something so i could strike them right in their face. fran (she is the 65 year old office secretary) started to say something under her breath. i couldn't tell exactly what she was saying but, it sounded like ""oh my lord, i guess we know what that means....inaudible....blah blah...etc."" i jumped up to my feet in about two shakes of a lambs tail. fran wasn't so big and bad when i was an inch away screaming in her face to try and say or do something. she backed down, they always do. well, there were a few minutes of awkward silence that was only broken by the occasional whimper from fran. finally we started again with the festivities. in a few minutes it was my turn to open up my present. well, after i had spent a pretty penny on the nighty, this lady goes out and gets me this mr. coffee mug warmer. i felt enraged! who did she think she was? i immediately stood up and told her that we were done. i never wanted to see her again, and i told her so. so again with water works and drama. at that point it didn't matter so i got up and went to my office. i have a fully stocked bar in the corner of my office and a couple fingers of single malt sounded pretty good at the time. i also have a projector screen and about seventy five full feature adult movies. the good stuff, like midgets that beat the holy heck out of one another with bamboo canes...stuff like that. it was the perfect place to collect my thoughts. that is probably why i didn't pay too much attention to what was going on outside.as i had stated before, my wife was starting to suspect that something may have been going on between me and the intern. what i didn't know, was that she had been spying on me for quite some time. can you imagine that? where is the trust and love in a marriage if it comes down to this? she should have been ashamed of herself but she had recently taken some women's right class in night school and was feeling all self ritechous. you know what i mean, that whole ""i am woman hear me roar"" bull spit. she was thinking about how she was going to make her move and i guess the best she could come up with was throwing a cup of hot coffee in my face. i don't know if she was going for some sort of ironic twist, or was just too dumb to think of anything better (i lean toward the latter of the two). so i am sitting there watching these two dwarfs going at it, while i sipped my scotch. i was finally starting to relax and feel the merry holiday spirit when i heard the office door squeak behind me. i started to turn around to see who it was. my brain was just barely able to recognize the figure in the doorway as my wife when all of the sudden this dark wall of black liquid hits me in the face. i have to admit, i wasn't ready for that. i sat there stunned for a moment or two and then my senses started coming back to me. the smell was what tipped me off to the fact that the liquid that was just thrown at my face was coffee. then i started to think about why i wasn't in severe pain from being assaulted with a hot beverage. i had heard a story about a guy who took mcdonalds to court after burning himself with their coffee. this stuff didn't even hurt a little. i pushed the thought out of my mind when i took chase after my wife. several hours later while i had her sitting in her timeout bench that i had built in the closet, i asked her why she threw cold coffee at me and not hot. between her sobs she explained that she had actually put the cup of coffee on the mug warmer for a good half hour and thought that it was piping hot. to her disappointment the contraption is a piece of junk and couldn't even get the drink to a hot temperature. after she apologized a few times i decided to let her out of her timeout hole. i was tired after the events and a foot massage was sounding pretty good. as she rubbed my feet a question crept into my mind. i asked her if she had plugged the thing in before she tried to heat up the coffee and she said she had forgotten. well, i married her for her father's money and mothers' looks; i guess a brain was too much to ask for. she finished the foot massage and i told her that if she went to go pick up the intern i might be able to forgive her before the new year. so, i guess in the end i can't really tell you if this thing works or not. i can only say for sure that it won't work if it is not plugged in! i can't believe we passed the 18th amendment giving them the chance to vote!

top,PRODUCT,"purchased this screen last week and it came with noticeable scrapes across the top. the box it came in was gigantic with plenty of packaging material, but the screen was packaged loosely at the bottom. however, since it was in another smaller box, i'm thinking that the scraping was there to begin with, and not from shipping. still deciding whether to go through the trouble of exchanging it since another reviewer said they had the same damage. i wouldn't want to risk getting another with the same damage and i really need a screen right now. other than the damage, it's a very nice screen.

"maroon,size","INFO,INFO","reading so many positive reviews for the intimo silk pant, i treated myself to one on may 15, 2010. i received my maroon silk pant quickly and they seemed all the reviewers had said they were. i followed the advice of one reviewer and ordered the ""silk pant"" a size larger. i loved them--they felt wonderful. i carefully followed the washing instructions, and all went well for over a month. long enough for the return period to expire, as i was soon to discover. then on a morning in late july, i removed my silk pant from the washer (only a year old ) from a solo cleaning on delicate to discover a seven inch rip where the silk joins the waistband. first, i sent an email to ""intimo"" customer service. their reply was quick, and thanked me for the information but put the blame on amazon. i contacted amazon and discovered my time had run out, so shame on me. for a month they were wonderful sleeping pants. if you think that is enough time to justify the expense, well order one. if you don't then look elsewhere for luxury sleep wear.

(10/27) finally the end of october came and it was delayed to my disappointment. (11/16) that thursday (11/15) i placed my preorder. the weekend went by and the product page still showed a preorder status (shipping 11/16) despite the fact it was the 18th! finally that wednesday i get a notification my order shipped that monday (11/19). checking my shipping status was also a dissapointment because it rarely updated. after much confusion with ups and the post office my order was delivered on the 28th. must have came from china i thought, despite the fact that it claims my order started in washington. opening it up the packaging was cheap but who cares! the case felt as good as it looked! i let if fully charge before i used to so i wouldnt have to worry about it for the rest of the week. i enjoyed that case for a whole day and thought it was the cat's pajamas.soon to my disappointment i found it started having pairing issues after one day. i couldnt get it to sync for long periods of time. and it only got worst. now it only syncs long enough for me to send one message before i have to re pair it. i cant tell if it the fact that the battery is dying but that couldnt be true, could it? they claim 2 weeks of moderate battery use so in my mind thats 8-10 days real world use.... but its dead after 4 days? sounds like a company you could trust! so today i started exploring the website to find out about how to get mine swapped, maybe its just a bad one. while searching i find ""boxwave's warranty policy."" how long does boxwave guarantee their products to work? 2 years like a good company should? nope. 1 year like most companies now a days do? nope. 100 days! 3.5 months.... do you know how short that is? that is the same warranty comapnies offer on refurbished products! so boxwave believes there $100 case is as good quality as a product that breaks and is then ""fixed"" and sold at a lower cost. its as good of quality as a used car sold by a used car dealer. a brand new premium product with the guarantee of a lower quality warranty. scary. even if i did swap mine out, i started having problems day 2, what happens on day 101?(3 months 11 days, not that far away) i go buy another $100 case? or do i reminisce of day one where everything was perfect and ignore the $100 other days of hell?stay away people. this is a $10 cases components wrapped in a $50 case shell sold for $100 and backed by a 100% satisfaction guaranteed refurbished warranty.for those who dont want to read and just skim to the bottom i will save you time:crap, crap, crap, crap, crap crap, crap, crap, crap, crap crap, crap, crap, crap, crap crap, crap, crap, crap, crap crap, crap, crap, crap, crap crap, crap, crap, crap, crap.

"phone,motorola,nokia","PRODUCT,BRAND,BRAND","probably the worst part of this phone is the texting. not only do i not like the style of the sms program, but the texting is so slow on this phone that i'll have a full sentence typed but it will still be one the first couple words. then you have to wait until it catches up to you and see if you've made a mistake. this gets really annoying if you're writing more than two word messages.the lag in texting applies to everything else. this is by far the slowest phone i have ever owned.the one positive thing i will say about this phone is that i like the option of having a normal ringtone (one that actually sounds like a phone); that, however, is a feature of all motorola phones.as far as the 2mp camera, do not buy this phone for the camera, as you will be disappointed. the quality is horrible. i thought that a 2mp camera would take better pictures than the 1.3 that i had on my previous phone. i was sadly mistaken. pictures from this phone look good neither on the phone or on a computer.if i could afford it, i would trash this phone and just buy a new one, but i'll have to wait until i can renew my contract and go back to nokia.

"phone,ear,phones,blackberry,motorola","PRODUCT,PRODUCT,PRODUCT,BRAND,BRAND","i've been a palm fanatic for over 10 years. i've always been an early adopter and bought the latest gadget when it first came out. i agree with many of these reviewers that the treo 600 was a breakthrough product and has great functionality, etc. but it is completely unreliable. i'm currently on my 3rd 600. each one died a hideous death after about 6 months. first the normal phone speaker died. so handspring replaced it for free. six months later the monster buzzing in my ear made using the phone impossible (in addition it had a nasty problem of doing a hard reset all on its own about once a week - often when i was traveling.) so again handspring replaced it. about 4 months into my 3rd device the monster screeching buzzing returned. this time when i called for a new one i was informed by palm that, ""we don't replace phones for free any more. it will cost you $200 to get a replacement."" so basically palm's business model is: we sell you a product that consistenly doesn't work and then we demand that you pay us as much to replace it (with another one that doesn't work) as you would have to spend to get a blackberry. it's unbelieveable. so i thought i'd suck it up and buy the 650 (even though two different friends bought it and both had already swapped it out for the same unreliability). but palm told me to get a 650 would cost me $700 ! i said, ""wait a minute, handspring used to give me the new phone each time at a discount if i'd send my old one back."" but i was informed that palm doesn't reward loyalty in any way anymore. what a joke.so i wrote a letter to the ceo of palm to complain. that was 5 months ago. no response or acknowledgement. what a disappointing company - in every aspect of it.i now use a motorola razor. palm is a joke. no serious business person can rely on the palm products or the company any more. shame.

"phone,motorola","PRODUCT,BRAND","the v600 model was originally designed for at&t. due to the at&t/cingular merger, cingular decided to take this model as well. however, cingular could not get the phone to fully work on their 850mhz network. that is why they started replacing the phones of their v600 customers for v400 models. all this corrective process (call it recall, if you wish) is carried out by cingular exclusively. as per the phone itself, the v600 is not being recalled or discontinued by motorola but is being recalled and discontinued by cingular. it is just cingular's network that is not capable of supporting this model. an easy way to test this is to try and activate this phone through at&t: it will experience no difficulties whatsoever. motorola will repair the phone, if necessary, and return it to you fully functional. however, if you wish to receive a replacement unit, you will need to contact cingular. a new motorola model is currently in development to replace the v600. the new model will be very similar to the v600 model.

"ear,hear,cover,phone,case,size","PRODUCT,PRODUCT,PRODUCT,PRODUCT,PRODUCT,INFO","i was very disappointed with the earglove. it looked so cool with the interchangeable foam covers and all, but i just couldn't get it to work for me. the build quality left a lot to be desired, and after several attempts to fit it comfortably, it sort of came apart, although i managed to get it together again. then i just couldn't get the earbud thing to fit in my ear; if i stuck it right in it was very painful, as it's not padded, and if i positioned it hovering outside my earhole, i could hardly hear a thing, especially when the car was moving. i had much better luck with a competitor earpiece which looped right around my ear, and had a broader speaker cover which sat outside my earhole and gave plenty of volume. another irritating thing about the earglove was the mute button, which if your phone is not compatible cuts off the call instead.i don't want to be too harsh since i think with these ear-thingies its just a case of finding one which fits the shape and size of your ear best. maybe the earglove would work well for you. its just a shame you have to buy one to find out. maybe a friend has one you could try for size first, because if it doesn't fit it will be useless.

"phone,hear,phones,windows,bluetooth,blue,headset","PRODUCT,PRODUCT,PRODUCT,BRAND,PRODUCT,INFO,PRODUCT","i had such faith in this phone when i first bought it. now that i am 7 treo phones later and it only being a year and a half....i have to say that this is the worst high end purchase i have ever gotten. in the beginning all of the reviews were wonderful from consumer reports and gadget blogs and electronic magazine reviews. however none of these publications seems to have let consumers know the truth about the horrible quality of these phones. as a pda they function fairly well but as a phone...the signal is always dropping (that is if there is a signal). friends and family claim it is hard to hear what i was saying when using the phone and that it sounded like i was in a tunnel. hearing what other people were saying was difficult. i would have to go outside to try to get a better signal just to hear what was being said. i purchased my phone through amazon to use with sprint. i invested in the monthly warranty to replace the phone. this seemed like a good plan until i realized that they were replacing my phone with refurbished phones that had the same problems as the handset that i had just given them. when my final sixth phone was replaced by sprint i made a call to a friend from the parking lot to ensure that it worked before i left the store (i had learned by this point). five minutes later yelling into the phone and trying to call back 3 times with no success (and no...the mute was not on). realizing that i had yet another dud on my hands i went back into the sprint store to take out the poor 16 year old clerk that had the misfortune of replacing my handset five minutes prior. apparently he had a panicked look on his face since he was waiting on customers who had just decided to get...you got it, a treo 600. well he quickly summoned his manager who decided to give me a brand-new never been opened treo 650 free. so yes i did get an upgrade free for all of my trouble. it is not much better than the treo 600. the signal is weak and it is hard to hear on both ends and when on vibrate mode the calls get sent straight to voicemail. convenient for emergencies i would say. i live in arizona but i sure do wish that i lived in california since there is currently a class-action suit against palm-one and the various cell phone carriers of the treo 600 and 650 for the poor quality of the product and replacing handsets with equally poor treos. at this point since the treo 700 just was released, it probably is not on the class action suit. however the treo 700 does run on a windows operating system which will make your palm os software from your treo 600/650 obsolete. it will also make it morevulnerable to viruses and lets not forget that little trick of being able to erase a bluetooth devices address book when someone has bluetooth enabled, also there is the ability to tap into peoples' conversations that they are having with their wireless blue-tooth headset. (not that i do it but i'm sure that some people are actually enjoying rush hour much more due to this security flaw). overall i would say that palm-one as a company has gone downhill in terms of quailty and customer service and that both the treo 600 and 650 are phones that i would not waste your time or money on.

"top,size,fabric,cover,curtain","PRODUCT,INFO,PRODUCT,PRODUCT,PRODUCT","i bought this product in may 2011 from another vendor (sleep warehouse) based on a lower price. so i can't comment on best beds as a merchant. but what i have to say about the sensus 5 pound/3"" deep queen-sized mattress topper is worth considering, regardless of where you might buy it.1. i bought the sensus to help with ""pressure points"" discomfort from side-sleeping on a very good, firm mattress. to my surprise, the foam topper, while helpful, did not eliminate the pressure point problem. i naively assumed that putting a soft layer on top of a firm mattress would improve my sleeping experience, but unfortunately it did not completely address pain in shoulders/hips from side sleeping.2. the product caused other problems i did not anticipate. within a few days of starting to use the sensus, i began having aches in my lower and middle back. before using sensus, i had never experienced routine lower and mid back problems from my sleeping arrangements. as you consider whether to buy sensus, think about whether it could actually cause pain in parts of your body that are not problematic right now. for me this was the deal breaker.3. i think sensus caused my lower/mid back problems because it is too soft. this is ironic, since many reviews rave about 5 pound density being the best and firmest choice. but it really isn't firm, which is kind of the point because the big selling point is that it will alleviate pressure point problems. 5 pound density may be ""firm"" relative to cheaper, lower density foam, but it is not truly ""firm"".so you've got this foam layer which is soft, but not ""too"" soft -- it is firm enough that you can still have pressure point issues, while being soft enough to cause lower and middle back pain. everyone is different, but if you buy sensus you're gambling that its softness level will relieve pressure points while not causing other back problems. don't assume you will achieve this optimal result.perhaps if i'd bought a 2 inch thickness the softness of the foam would have blended optimally with the firmness of my mattress to alleviate pressure point issues while not creating lower/mid-back problems. but i'll never know....4. the sensus is very fragile and very unwieldy. it is extremely easy to damage it, especially in the unpacking process. you have to pry apart the foam -- it sticks pretty tightly to itself and the prying apart process is time consuming and quite tricky.the fragility of sensus is ideal for merchants because if you want to return the product (as i do) any damage will prevent you from persuading the merchant to take it back. the 5 pound density, 3"" deep topper weighs about 50 pounds in queen size, so getting it out of the package, unpeeling it into a flat rectangle, coaxing it into a fabric encasement and then getting it atop your bed is quite a job. and then if you decide to return it, the whole process has to be gone through in reverse... and you can only return it if all of this labor proceeds with no damage taking place with the topper.i assure you that it is virtually impossible to unpack, unfold, encase, install, de-install, de-encase, re-fold and re-pack this topper without some damage occurring. therefore it is very unlikely you'll be able to return this sensus product, so do think very carefully before buying it. despite my best efforts, mine has several divots on the edges and some dirt in one spot where the packaging opened up en route to my house, so it is probably a total loss. with the cover that's $409 down the drain. i might try cragislist, or i might just send it off to a charity. or i might just chop it into little bits and landfill it. not sure yet what i'll do with this thing now that i'm done with it in just 3 weeks...5. sensus has an odor. many people write about odors emanating from various mattress toppers, and the stories are quite true. i aired my sensus out on the floor for 4 days before installing it, and even now some 3 weeks later it is still smelly. the odor is more musty than chemical -- think mildewed linens smell more than new shower curtain smell. i am unsure whether the mildewy smell is because of how the topper was warehoused before shipment or is inherent to this type of foam... for me it is not a huge issue, but for those who really dislike odors in their sleeping products it needs to be considered.6. when you see photos of a hand print in ""memory"" foam with the hand hovering over the print it has just etched in the foam, do not take those photos at face value. the photos imply the ""memory"" foam has a pronounced tendency to hold whatever form is pressed into it for an extended time period. but no....i tested this sensus topper -- stuck my hand deep in the foam, held it there for 30 seconds with consistent pressure, and then quickly withdrew my hand. it takes less than 4 seconds for any trace of my hand imprint to vanish. the photos imply something much longer, and it just ain't so. with standard high density foam you get no ""memory"" and with this expensive stuff you get a 3.5 second ""memory"". standard foam costs far, far less than this stuff, so is it worth hundreds of dollars for 3.5 seconds of ""memory""?
