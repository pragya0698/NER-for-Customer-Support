Clothing_Accessories,"normally, you'd expect a company to understand a man and his underwear. sadly, ua does not.when i received this underwear, i was able to wear it once. once. why? because it simply fell the hell apart half way through my day as i was wearing it.chances are, this is just a defective case. yeah, probably. so what do i do? i go and contact ua support. first of all, i had to continuously try to get them to actually talk to me. i'd say i had a problem with their underwear breaking down on me. what do they say? to use the return form and send it back, followed by an immediate disconnection! i had to try continuously contacting them to get them to say anything else what so ever. when i finally do, i ask whether or not i could just provide proof of purchase (a receipt + picture). they simply deny me.i mean, really. sending back a gross, dirty pair of underwear that you sweated in all day to the point they break isn't something you want to do. after denying me, they refused to talk to me whatsoever. they simply disconnect as soon as i enter the chat, refusing to talk to me at all! furthermore, their employees constantly gave attitude and belittled me at the same time.ua, you're a damn shame. a damn shame.

Cell_Phones_Accessories,"this charger works great on my motorola razr v3m, but i'd just like to point out that this is not as pictured. the m on the front of the cigarette lighter jack does not light up blue, but rather there is a blue led beneath the m. this is obviously, as another reviewer stated, a knock off of the original. i'd purchase this again however, as it's $3 instead of the $8 for the one with the light-up m.

Cell_Phones_Accessories,"bought it in dec 06 at the mall. unfortunately paid like ten bucks.i used to carry it on my belt. recently the swivel joint popped off when i was getting out of my car, and i don't even have a pot belly.if you can afford $4 per two months of usage, get it. if not, pouch is probably better.

Home_Kitchen,"i'm very disappointed in this thing. i would say it needs an auto shut-off but it would be a waste of time and energy. this warmer keeps the bottom of the cup nice and warm but the liquid inside remains tepid. the warming surface is too small for my large, ceramic mug. the price was ok but i'm shopping for another. my advice, don't waste your money unless you want to warm anything larger than a demitasse.
"
Home_Kitchen,"i bought the thing, then read the reviews. i tried everything including using a flat bottom cup for maximum contact, pre-heating the cup and making sure the coffee was hot when put on the device. i left the warmer on for 5 minutes so it was ""hot"" before putting the coffee on it. when one does this, the coffee cools off(!) when on the warmer. gets cooler! it simply does not run hot enough to work. it does work if you only put an inch of pre-heated coffee in a pre-heated cup. then it keeps it semi hot. i took mine back to bb&b.

Home_Kitchen,"the manufacturer packed this product so poorly that the plastic joints between sections of the tree were smashed, and the pole in the center of the tree was bent beyond redemption. i have no idea how this tree looked all put together since i had to repack it and send it back. thankfully amazon.com's return policy is generous and swift - they get five stars for service! in the meantime, it was a real tree for me again this year . . . i may try to go with an artificial one next year, but will not order one online again.

Cell_Phones_Accessories,"pros:- light weight solution for both an audio source and cell phone- good sound quality on both ends- comfortable fit- travel case for protectioncons:- 0.5 second delay when watching video (must use the hardwire solution)- the original msrp is a bit high for something that is not closer to perfect- not all of the audio controls work, even when using the dongle- cannot use while driving (therefore you must have another headset for this purpose)i am looking into buying this unit from a friend's electronic's store. he was gracious enough to loan a floor model to me for a night. i spent some time reading reviews from many different sites and i have to say, while the reviews at amazon were the most technically oriented, they were also the most critical. therefore, i made it my goal to attept to disprove some of the claims that i read here in the hopes of finding this product to be a real gem. among the claims that i attempted to disprove were:- failure to charge- 0.5 second delay affecting video- poor audio sound quality from dongle (i.e. when using an ipod/laptop)- hoaky switch between dongle and phone when making/receiving calls- find the source of the ""design flaw""the tests were done with the following items:- ibook g4 1.2ghz- lg vx9800 (mine)- motorola e815 (caller)- 5th gen 60gb ipod video- belkin bluetooth usb adapter (model f8t003)the first tests that we ran, naturally, were to see if we could pair the vx9800 up with the headset. that took all of two seconds; very easy. i then walked into another room and called the e815. the quality was no better or worse then any of your other higher end bluetooth headsets. what makes the difference is that you now have two ears focused in on the conversation, so in a sense, you're hearing more and paying attention more to the phone conversation (versus having the noise of the office in your other ear). i initally walked away from my cell phone and it got a bit garbled, but as soon as i brought my cell phone with me, i had no problems. i then switched phones with the caller so that i could hear what she was hearing. the quality was good. i didn't have any problems hearing what she was saying to me. voice dial worked beautifully from the headset and i didn't find myself shouting.the next test that we did was to pair up the dongle and use it with the ipod (audio first). pairing up the dongle was very easy. while edward rios claims that the audio he heard was ""no better then am radio"", i firmly disagree with this statement. i started out playing some classical (with no eq settings set on the ipod). i'll agree that the quality of the audio was not on the same level as my seinnheiser's, however once i adjusted the eq in the ipod the bass and thus the quality was improved somewhat (bass booster setting worked well). i also noticed that the track jogger did not work with the ipod. in the manual it states ""only works if bluetooth device supports bluetooth audio/video remote control profile (avrcp); does not work when using universal adapter."" this was a bit disappointing because it was feature i was looking forward to. the ""play/pause"" button did work... somewhat. the audio pauses, but not on the ipod. next we moved on to receiving a phone call. as a call came in, i heard a beep in the headset. pressing the call button, the music stopped and the call interrupted. once the call was complete, the phone hung up and the music continued (please note that the ipod did not pause during this time, only the source of the signal switched). this was tested several times. it was very easy. however, i do agree with steve gardner in his assessment that the dongle is a short term pair. in other words, if you turn the dongle off, you will need to pair it again (once again, a very simple process).on to the video. i turned on some family guy that i had on my ipod. i indeed did notice that there was some amount of delay, but with cartoon characters, it wasn't that obvious. not a problem, i decided to up the ante. i then turned on an episode of the office, specifically a scene where steve carrell is speaking. yes, there is a .05 second delay. it seems to fluctuate as if the dongle is racing to catch up. i then put the pulsar in headset mode by turning it off and plugging in the hardwire cable. this fixed the problem (this same resolution was found by both testers). my final thoughts on this? unless you're planning on trying to watch video from across the room, this solution will work for you.feeling a bit adventurous, i decided to test the headset with my ibook. i first tried to pair the pulsar up with my ibook using the belkin bt adapter. that didn't work. although i heard it clicking when the pairing process was going on, it never went through. not a problem, i'll use the dongle. using the dongle i was again able to hear the audio, but i was not able to get the unit to work as a mic/headphone combination. others have claimed to be able to get this to work, but for the average person, the short answer is that it doesn't work that great. i'm going to take n. nelson's comments one step further, if i may, and say that this unit is really only for audio sources / cell phone combinations.at the end of the night i decided to charge it. i placed it in the cradle and, sure enough, it started charging. at some point later i picked it up and then placed it back in the cradle and it didn't charge! i thought, ""a'ha! i proved another one true!"" not so fast... i took out the usb charger to see if the problem was the cable and began charging the headset off of that. a few minutes later i put the headset back in the cradle and low and behold, it began charging again! is there a hardware problem here? i'm not sure, but that is what i found. it charged smoothly the rest of the night.unfortunately, the one thing i was not able to test in a 24 hour time span was the design flaw. obviously i would have to use it every day for two weeks to see if this is true. my gut instinct is telling me that it's possible a bad batch of product is to blame, but i have no way of proving this. until i see it, i can't put faith in that it will happen to me. all i will say on this is that it apparently has happened to more then one person so it is possible that it could happen to you. one thing i did notice is that the headset gets ""stretched"" as you wear it, but then it gets ""compressed"" as you put it back in the cradle. could it be that all this stretching and compressing is causing the cracks? would this have happened to these people if they didn't use the cradle? i don't know. maybe the design flaw is in the cradle itself and not the headset. who knows...my final analysis of this product overall is very good. i don't think plantronics set out to make this the ""one stop shop"" for all headset needs (although they might want to have a conversation with their marketing department about ""truth in advertising""). while i was typing this i was listening to some good ol' fashioned punk rock using the dongle and i was bouncing my head the whole time; very enjoyable. i do believe that plantronics is preparing for the next wave in bluetooth technology by adding support for profiles that others don't support yet. all in all, if you're looking for a headset that can seamlessly switch between your cellphone and your ipod, then this will work for you. if you're looking for an ""one stop shop"" you will be sorely disappointed. one thing i would have liked to see would be some sort of design improvement where one of the earphones could flip outward thus to be legally complaint with driving requirements. they are the best option available (the motorola pair does not come with a transeiver which is something you have to purchase extra... and something else you have to carry and something else you run the risk of losing). in the end, will i buy these? probably, but i won't be running towards the store like a bat out of hell.

Home_Kitchen,"i've had one house guest and one nanny place this kettle on my gas stove believing it's a standard kettle. the first time, i wrote cuisinart a letter, and they graciously sent me a new kettle. great customer service. the second time, i'm going with a less confusing design, the capresso glass electric kettle for a couple extra bucks. it's not worth burning my house down ; ).this design looks just like cusinart's other standard kettles. so if you have elderly parents, or people what are not familiar with recent developments in water boiling, you might want to consider a less confusing design. (p.s. the plastic base melts in seconds if it comes in contact with a heat source).

Cell_Phones_Accessories,"it's cheap, eforcity delivers quickly, however, may not actually be oem. all of the oem chargers i've seen (model number syn0847) has glowing stylized ""m"" motorola logo. this item, however, does not; it only has a small blue led underneath the ""m"" that glows when it's plugged in. all of the other labeling on the charger looks authentic motorola. maybe a really good knockoff? anyway, does the job just fine (see title), and, again, it beats paying $20 at cingular.

Cell_Phones_Accessories,"bought two of these and it always breaks in the same place after several months of use, if not sooner. other reviewers have had the same experience. the problem lies with the plastic slide where you attach your palm. it is flimsy and not detailed properly re. interface with the metal case itself. it invariably breaks after several openings/closings, if not before. i had a rhino case before on another palm and it looks as if i will have to try that or a leather one again.

Cell_Phones_Accessories,"the phone itself is pretty good, feels comfy in the hand and the bottons protrude and ""click"" so it gives nice tactile feedback, something missing from almost every phone on the markey. so you know what you're pressing at all times, almost no texting errors.however, two flaws, and one of them is major.1. how can a phone not have an input for an earbud? this is absolutely unacceptable, and i've never seen a phone in the last 6-7 years not have a simple ear bud jack, ridiculous! this is the sole reason i returned mine, as i do not care for bluetooth, i prefer simple corded earbuds as they are cheap to replace if lost.2. another pretty serious flaw is the battery. it is rated at 3 hours, but that is pushing it.overall this could have been a great phone, but two pretty stupid, unthinkable mistakes like not including a basic earbud jack ruins it.

Home_Kitchen,"we purchased this microwave in october for $300 minus the $50 rebate. panasonic denied our first rebate submission, claiming we'd bought the wrong item. a phone call cleared up the misunderstanding and apparently our rebate is on its way. however, i've since been told that rebate problems and denials are a common occurrence with panasonic.the microwave has a nice appearance and functions well. however, there is a significant design flaw. you cannot use the hood light as a nightlight or even keep it on for very long without heating up the inside of the microwave to the point where the internal fan comes on and the microwave will not turn on to cook. after the oven cools down, it seems to function normally. the first time this happened, the inside of the oven was so hot i thought it was a short circuit. for that reason, i do not recommend buying this appliance. i wonder if this is why the price has dropped dramatically...

Clothing_Accessories,"this review is for the sunglass eyeglass repair kit 77pc deluxe sold by: jckringlesi needed some small screws to fix some glasses. i did not expect much to about $8, but i did not think i would get such cr*p. most of the screws had no slot on the end. this means that there is no way to tighten them. they had inserted a note in the kit""screws w/out slots fit into round end of screwdriver and tighten with friction"".no! no! no! it just does not work. first of all, there is no round end of the screwdriver. 2nd, even if there was, there is just no way you could hope to hold down a completely smooth and rounded end of a very little screw, so it could be tightened. to be fair, some of the screws did have slots, but the longer ones did not. the long ones were the only ones that i needed, so this purchase was a complete waste of time & $. i would never order anything else from this store. if they would sell this, then you can not trust them. they obviously got an order of screws that were defective & are trying to get rid of them. just think about it. no one wants little screws ( or orders them that way) with no slots.eyeglass repair kit - 1 kit

Cell_Phones_Accessories,"this case is unbelievably poorly designed. the leather covering the belt clip started coming apart almost immediately, and the rivets connecting it to the case ripped out within weeks.if you're looking for a ""disposable"" case that you plan to replace every month or two, this isn't necessarily a bad value for the price. the phone does fit it nicely, even with the extended battery installed. but if you want something that will last, this is definitely not the product to buy.

Home_Kitchen,"this steamer set is not worth the price. i read the negative reviews and assumed people were just picky, but that is not the case. i have used this steamer 2-3 times per day since it arrived. the quality is very low; metal is thin and feels cheaply made. the lid cracks and pops as it heats up and cools down. the steamer is not small, but isn't as big as it looks in the picture. when i am steaming something, if i put the stove on high, water spits out from around the lid making a huge mess. i have to put the stove on medium-high, and set the lid on the edge to prevent it from spitting, which increases the cook time.if i could do it again, i would not purchase this item. i anticipate i will need to buy another steamer in 6 months or so and will spend a little more to get a better quality item.update 1/2013: i did get rid of this. after getting, as a wedding gift, a complete new set of pans, we bought another ""norpro 175 stainless steel vegetable steamer"" which fits inside your existing pans. nine dollars, and well worth it.

Clothing_Accessories,"first thing you have to know about clothes: there are certain names the are your guarantee of quality (think something like ralph lauren), because these designers impose a certain quality level on the clothes that have their label attached.then there are certain names that mean...nothing. that's because these ""designers"" are simply labels available for license to whatever comes down the pike. bill blass is one of these, at least for cheaper clothes.these shirts represent the very worst of the kinds of clothes that come down that aforementioned pike. slap a bill blass label on them, claim a high list price, and pawn them off on unsuspecting customers via mail order (where you can't see them first, because if you saw them first it wouldn't take you two seconds to realize they stink).these shirts are extremely thin, as has been mentioned before. beyond that, they are not particularly well made. if you care at all about your clothes, you'll regret buying these at any price (including the extremely cheap price at which they are currently available from amazon) and, if you have any self resepct, you'll immediately toss them in that bag you keep for clothes to be donated to the local goodwill store.is it worth even a few dollars to confirm what i'm telling you is true? i say not. why toss your money in the street?

Home_Kitchen,"this item arrived promptly and in good condition. my teenage son assembled it in a couple of hours before i arrived home from work, so i gather that it went together easily enough. the cart, being real wood, looks quite nice, but the legs, top, etc. are pieced together from multiple pieces of wood, which raises some questions in my mind about strength and long-term durability. if only it had lasted that long...after using the unit for less than a week, one of the casters disintegrated without warning (massive structural failure of the plastic housing) as i was pointing the cart in a different direction. we had a 27"" crt-based tv plus a dvd and vcr on the cart at the time, and luckily none of them fell off as the cart tipped sharply when the caster collapsed. altogether it was about 100 lbs. of gear, but the cart is large enough that it should be designed to accommodate a significantly larger tv than the one we had on it.comparing the casters on this cart with those on a smaller tv cart that we were replacing, i discovered that these were smaller and of lighter construction -- clearly undersized for this cart, which is a design flaw rather than a manufacturing problem. i drilled out the holes in the legs to accommodate the larger casters from the old cart (which we had used for a couple of years with the same tv/vcr/dvd setup), so i'm hopeful that if the legs themselves don't give way, we'll be able to get some use out of this unit after all.to summarize, i would recommend this unit only for light duty use with small tv's.

Cell_Phones_Accessories,"hello,i am a scientist in the field of microwave/rf circuits and systems. i considered several but finally chose the jabra a210 along with the bt250 jabra headset. this review is for both items together.a few things to note:1) swithcing on and off is not very intuitive for the bt250, you have to hold down the power button for ""n"" number of seconds, the lights will flash in a certain pre-ordained sequence, but if you do hold down the power button more than what is required (this is sketchy), then the appliances enter set up mode, and the pairing between the adapter and the headset might be lost. the a210 is paired by means of a stylus pressing down a depressed switch on the body of the unit. so its pairing is not affected by the power button. but this set (headset and the adapter) have 8 hours talk time and 240 hours standby time (as per manufacturer's claim), even if it performs up to 80% of the reported claim, you wont have to mess around too much with the power switch. you can comfortably use it during the day and come home at night and recharge the set.2) quality of sent and received signals. please note: the jabra a210 has a pin which can be put in to 3 settings. setting # 1 is for motorola phones, setting # 3 for all other phones and setting # 2 is for when you feel discomfort in setting # 1 or # 3. i have a lg vx 6100 non-bluetooth phone from verizon. i tested the settings extensively by calling a friend. (thanks guddu.) i tried setting # 1, there were 2 noticeable problems: (a) my friend complained that the volume of my voice was low, but the clarity was good.(b) i could not use the button on the head set to connect and disconnect calls.but i must mention, i could receive my friend's voice in absolutely loud and clear tones.both the problems were alleviated when i used setting # 3 on the adapter. in fact, when i started using setting # 3, my friend complained that my voice was too loud! there werent any issues related to clarity.3) range: the manufacturer claims this to have a range of 10 meters (30 feet). but at the same time, in its manual, it is written that if there are objects in the wireless signal path between the adapter and the headset, the sound quality will suffer.now we have to consider 2 trade offs for every rf design. (a) power (b) size. we all want the smallest devices with maximum power and range. well physics and electronics sharply put us back in our places. if you want greater range, you need to put out signal with great field strength. that needs higher battery consumption, high efficiency non linear amplifiers and large antennas. microstrip patch antennas (generally used for their low profiles and small size) resonate to a particular frequency if their length is correctly defined. but with design modifications, this length can be shortened, but the gain suffers. also, thanks to the fcc, we have very strict limitations on the frequency bands available (the higher the frequency, the shorter the wave length, and thus smaller the antenna and consequently higher the gain). fcc makes many rf devices work at lower frequencies than we rf engineers would like them to operate at. also, due to fear of signal from one device interferring with other devices, fcc puts limits on the amount of power a device can put out.given these considerations, the a210 and bt250 which are required to have excellent power efficiency (8 hours talk time and 240 hours stand by time) and also small and compact size (very small batteries and small antennas) provide a range which is not quite satisfactory. i walked at a radius of 10 feet and even with walls, metal partitions, etc, the signal strength was not that affected. how ever more than 10 feet, the signal had so much noise in it, i had to move closer to the adapter.to be honest with you, i am not happy with the range. i dont think the range is $130 worth (for the adapter and headset = $50 + $80). period. for a 10 feet range the cost should have been more like $50 (for both).so basically, we have reviewed some basic factors. however, there is one major design flaw that i would like to bring to your attention. that is: the head set and the adapter enter in to stand by mode after one minute of non-usage. so even when you are in the middle of a call and both parties keep silent for more than a minute, the head set and the adapter stop communicating. the call is not disconnected. you can either pull the adapter jack out of the cell phone and put it back in, or press the volume key on the cell phone (basically do some thing with the cell phone) and you will be able to resume the conversation on the bluetooth devices. how ever this is not voice operable. meaning, if the adapter and the headset enter in to stand by mode during the conversation when both parties to the call are silent, even when they both start talking, the adapter and the head set do not start communicating.this is extremely uncomfortable. if i have a blue tooth head set and adapter kit for which i have paid $130 or more, then i want absolute mobility with out any reason to come back to the adpater unless i do so from my own free will.lastly, here is a recommendation for the people who designed this set. you need to incorporate greater features in to this adapter and head set. it should be able to not only handle voice data but also music and other types of audio information. this means you might need to use a more efficient method of modulation. maybe you are using fsk which is constant envelope modulation (i deal with military and radar communication, so i dont know what modulation is used for blue tooth), but you cannot include too much information in to the fsk signal. try using qam, maybe not a very high order qam, but some thing capable of handling all audio information. all you will need to change in the design is: a new power amplifier which is high efficiency and linear. probably a class e or class f with feed forward or envelope elimination and restoration (kahn) or doherty principles. it is simple. you will need a one time engineering development cost, but in the long term - with market domination and mass production, it will more than make up for it.as for buyers. if you are rich, a techno geek or a business person constantly on the phone - go for this. it is good.but if you have limited resources (money) then buy a simple wired hands free kit. in fact at times when the battery is down or i have to move to get back within range, i long for the reliability of a wired handsfree kit.update: june 25th, 2005: by the way, i lost one a210 and recently purchased one more. i tried one more test on it recently. i got a adapter from radio shack (part # 274-397) which accepts 3/32"" submini stereo plug ( as is the plug of the a210) and fits a 1/8"" mini stereo jack (as is the plug for all standard head phone jacks). thus i connected the a210 to the adapter and connected to my new creative muvo mp3 player. then put on my bt250. it worked!! i could hear the music through the blue tooth set up!but the music quality was poor... this blue tooth unit probably has enough sampling rate for speech, it is not able to handle the sudden and faster changes in amplitude, phase and frequency of a music signal.nevertheless it works.kaushik.

Cell_Phones_Accessories,"this phone deserves zero rating. or minus 1. it's that bad. it just turned itself off for no reason, while i was on a very important call with someone whose number i don't have. battery is half full, but it decided to take a break a guess. i turned it on, and it works fine now.other problems:- buttons don't click any more even though they do seem to work; but those that don't ""click"" any more need tons of pressure to work.- navigation through menus is cumbersome for some simple things like sending a text message.- sound is bad as is both reception and transmission. this in a good coverage area. the biggest problem is it cuts off for no reason.- camera is like a trip back to the earliest digital cameras of early 90s. picture quality is so bad, you'll wish you never even tried taking those pictures.- i never even use this phone for anything else other then phone calls. i don't really care about the camera, mp3 and so on, so i am dissapointed that even simple things like staying on when battery is full, is a challenge.- battery life is bad.- battery indicator is worse. you may leave home with battery half full only to find out that it's getting empty within minutes. and - yes - i do charge my phone fully, and use it until the battery is (almost) empty.- both my wife and i have the same phone. we use it not more then once to twice a day. very very light use. yet both of our phones exibit identical problems. buttons on her phone got bad even faster then mine - within days of purchasing it.all in all i don't remember when was the last time i was so dissapointed with my purchase. this phone feels like some bootleg black market import, not a real nokia. however i bought it from at&t; so it's real.

(i tried an adapter to see if it was my mp3 player being stubborn, but i can confirm it is the monster cable that is not working). it is now so unusable i decided to throw it away.otherwise, for when it worked, i had no complaints about it!

Home_Kitchen,"i have a rival mug warmer that i've enjoyed for years. no idea where i got it. i just know it's been a champ! recently, my husband was ill and wanted to use it for the broth or tea he was constantly sipping. he got better, i requested it back, he returned it, then stole it again two days later. so, time for me to get to get a new one, right?unfortunately, this mr. coffee warmer is no rival to my rival! my rival is so hot that the bottom several sips of coffee are almost (not quite) too hot to drink, and that's how i like it. on the few occasions i've forgotten about it, it's still hot hours and hours later, and there will have been some evaporation/concentration of the leftover coffee!the mr. coffee, on the other hand, lets the coffee cool to barely above tepid after a mere half hour. i deliberately left the bottom few sips for awhile, and even that last little bit got colder. this just is not acceptable. at all.oh, and to be very clear, for my test of this mug warmer, i was sure to use the same mug i always use for my coffee (so no difference in surface area contacting the warmer), i pre-warmed the mug to almost too-hot-to-touch, and i prewarmed the warmer itself for about two minutes before placing my piping-hot mug of coffee on it. with all that, for it to be tepid at the bottom in 30 minutes is just ridiculous.i just requested a refund, and was very pleased to be told by amazon that i wouldn't have to hassle with actually returning this thing in order to get said refund. my husband is going to see if it will be adequate for him, because he's actually fine with ""tepid"". (and i'll be taking back my rival warmer, thank you!) when i unplugged the mr. coffee warmer in order to give it to him, i noticed that the bottom of the thing was warmer than the warming plate itself. yeah. let's waste the heat out the bottom of it, rather than directing it to where it does the most good. *sigh*

Cell_Phones_Accessories,"let's start with the bad things:1: there's no way this battery will ever give 2 weeks of standby time in the real world. when i first got it, about 7 months ago, it would give 5-6 days. not bad, but a far cry from the ""1-2 weeks"" that was promised.2: it decays fast. 7 months ago i could get 5-6 days of standby time. this battery has now been reduced to being 1-2 days. the ""zero memory effect"" claim is also worthless.personally, i'd avoid the sch-3500 at all costs. while it seems like it should be a decent phone, it has a myriad of problems. i'm currently on my second, the first one died after less than a year of very light use. pick a different phone and battery system.

Cell_Phones_Accessories,"the nokia 6126 has some very nice features (most of which are also found on newer phones). my gripe is that this phone is incompatible with every pc-to-phone software program available. the only program which is available is the ""nokia pc suite"" (free at nokia web site). but that program can't do near what most other cell-to-pc programs can do.the nokia suite for this phone cannot dedect the contents of the sim card, nor the sim itself. hence, many features are inaccessible.(only phone memory and the add on miro-chip memory is available.)the contact list editor is the worst ever i've seen. the contact list should be the core on any phone. if you want to play mp3's - get an mp3 player. the sound quality is severely lacking, and no bass at all.if you want a camera - get a digital camera because clarity will be a world of difference. that leaves us with a contact list editor.(1) cumbersome pop up windows for entries, rather than as all other programs do, which can be edited on one single page and can be printed out. the nokia 6126 does not have printing, neither does the nokia 6125 pc suite. (it will allow you to print 1 contact per page -- good luck printing 40 pages which would normally fit on 1 page.)there are plenty of sites that only discuss the good points, and i agree it's a nice phone if the core reason for having a phone, contacts and appointment calendar editing & printing wouldn't be so cumbersome or simply unavailable.my last beef is battery life. for my purposes, standby gives me relative sufficient time, but use the phone with pc sync, one better hurry.charging time runs between 2 1/2 to 3 hours on a home 110v charger.

Cell_Phones_Accessories,"i have had thins headset for several months now and have to confess i hardly use it. i bought it for my t-mobile telephone and while pairing was easy, when walking down the street the microphone seems to act like a wind tunnel - wind just blows straight into the microphone and no one can hear me over the combination of street noise and wind.i don't think it is a t-mobile gsm issue although the microphones on their handsets seem to be so super sensitive that listeners often say they can hear my footsteps and the conversations of others around me better than they can hear me.overall, not very workable and i'm disappointed. have actually just ordered a plantronics m3500 which boasts a noise-canceling microphone. we'll see if there is any improvement.finally, i thought that at least i'd be able to use this headset for skpye. it works a charm on my mac although people say i'm faint, but on my windows machine i am completely unable to get the sound to come out of the jabra earpiece; only through the speakers on my computer. while that is better i think than having to listen to a telephone conversation through stereo headphones (which, incidentally, is unbearable and cuts you off from everything going on around you), it is not perfect.

Cell_Phones_Accessories,"i recently bought this phone for 20$ as a gophone after losing my samsung sync :( i was fully prepared for a phone that was way below the sync but this phone is on par and better in some areas.pros:the speaker is amazingly loud-especially compared to the sync. voice quality is normal. the cool thing is that you can play music while doing anything else you want!the screen is the same vibrant big screen as the sync and many newer phones. you can even change the main screen so that it has shortcuts and a calender like a smartphone!cons:the flip button works great unles you accedentaly block the flip with your finger.the sd card is behind the battery cover. this is not a problem unless you take the card out a lot.battery life is extremely short but if you charge it every night it should be good.overall i liked this phone as much as the sync and better in some respects

"
Cell_Phones_Accessories,"see my review of the coby ca-745 transmitter for some background.i purchased this monster radioplay 300 based on the price and overall rating. it arrived broken and used. the wire near the socket connector was positional, meaning that it was broken inside and only worked when the wire was at a specific angle; the wire dangles and swings when driving, so the transmitter was unusable. plus, the display and body were both scratched up a lot, so i concluded that the company sent me one that had been returned because it was broken. i assume that the quality control program in their shipping/receiving department needs better management. when i contacted the seller, they apologized, refunded my money and sent me a new one at no cost, so i'd say their pr department is great!the replacement works, and is adequate, but when i received the coby transmitter (which i had ordered right after receiving the first monster), i was blown away at how much better the latter one is, and at a comparable price.so the bottom line is, the company has a qc problem which they can fix, and i wish them the best of luck. their quick and unsolicited response of refunding my purchase price and sending me a workable replacement is a good sign that they are trying, so kudos to them for their effort. as for the transmitter itself, it's okay but just not as good as the coby.

Cell_Phones_Accessories,"when i bought my blackberry, my battery lasted for 2 days of intensive use. it went like that for a full year and then in a matter of a week or two my battery life halved, i could only get a day out of it of not so quite an intensive use. i was delighted to see that amazon offered a new battery at what seemed a very attractive price, in comparison with what a cell store would charge. however, after using this battery that i purchased from amazon i get the same sort of medium sized day that i get with my old battery. this leads me to conclude that the vendor is recycling used batteries as new ones. it is cheap, but it is not new. if you don't have a battery at all get it. if you want to replace your old battery pay the $40 at a cell store and get the really new one.

Cell_Phones_Accessories,"i researched and ordered the nokia boom headset (hdb-5) for the nokia 2600, which was suppose to work for the nokia 2600. upon receiving it i was very disappointed because when i would plug it into my nokia 2600 it kept coming up with the message 'enhancement not supported'. i tried everything to get it to work (including taking it over to my cell phone store and asking them if i was doing something wrong). they couldn't even come up with an answer. you need to take the boom headset (hdb-5) off of the list of enhancements for the nokia 2600, because it does not work for that model. as you can see it gets a very low rating from me, since it didn't work for my cell phone. your list of enhancements is very misleading and right now i have no hands off device for my nokia 2600 because of your misleading list.

"
Cell_Phones_Accessories,"i have changed to gsm and selected the v3xx phone as the motoroal v60 was the best phone i have ever owned. the razr v3xx has some short commings that anyone considering it should know about. first of all you have to have the phone really centered on your ear to hear it at its best 1/4 inch makes a difference. the front screen is too small to read incoming call numbers, so it is useless for caller id. both inside and external screens are hard to read in bright sunlight. the srceens are great in reduced light or indoors. the start call(green) and end call(red) buttons are right next to buttons that start the at&t browser or cv both of which will cost you if you press one by mistake and cancel as quickly as posible, you learn to look at the buttons you are pressing, not a good idea if you are driving. i have not been able to find a good blue tooth device to use while driving. i have purchased two units with built in speakers and three ear piece devices. the best is the motorola h700 (i bought it from amazon to avoid fake look alikes and the $99.00 asked by at&t). the h700 is scratchy but usable in a car. the quality and volume of the blue tooth on any of the devices i have tried is about equal to the built in speaker. the last issue with the phone is battery life, if i am lucky i get two days charge on a battery. i probably place or receive four to five short calls a day. sometimes i run out of battery on the second day, so now i just plug the phone in each night. my old phones nokias, motorolas, and panasonics (all digital not gsm) lasted between one or two weeks on a charge. i guess i'll have to adjust to the new technology!

Cell_Phones_Accessories,"i bought the jabra earset for my nokia 5190 about a month ago. a friend of mine also bought the same earset and i was able to hear them talking on theirs (using nokia 6190). the receiver sound quality (talking) is slightly worse than a normal cellphone. it sounds somewhat distant and echoey. also, it picks up background noise, especially from a car and almost seems to amplify the noise, making it hard for people to hear you. the speaker (listening) for the user is very clear and i had no problems finding an earpiece adapter that fit me.problem: the biggest problem i've noted with these earsets is an annoying background &quot;buzz&quot;. i have been told that this is caused by the earpiece wire picking up reception from the cellphone antenna. this buzz can be heard both on your side and the person you are talking to can hear it as well, creating quite an annoyance. in fact, this background buzz is so bad at times that i have stopped using my jabra earset entirely unless i am driving (it is law in california). the only way to get rid of the buzz is to orient the wire in certain positions or hold the wire in certain places (very impractical, especially if you are moving around). i would return this item and buy something else except that i bought it using an amazon discount certificate, so i can't. i've been told that not all earsets have this problem so it is probably advisable that you if you get this you are able to return it or try it out first.

Cell_Phones_Accessories,"please take time to read this review, and if you want to save yourself a lot of frustration, take into account this review before you even think about buying this phone.the phone texts so slowly that if you type in a word with more than two letters you have to wait for it to catch up with you. if you try to just type everything in all at once without seeing what you wrote the phone will jumble letters and get confused.the only way to see which are incoming calls and which are outgoing calls is to look closely to see if there is a blue or orange arrow next to the person. it took me a month to figure this out, the symbols are very small and there are no separate sections for outgoing/incoming/missed calls.there is no way to turn off repeated vibrate when you get a text. it will continue to vibrate, over and over and over, (spaced about a two minutes apart) until you've read the text.the phone itself is slow. when you push a button, it doesn't instantly take you where you want to go, there is about a three second lag, which doesn't sound bad but if you are doing more than just calling someone it gets annoying pretty quickly. it reminds me of dial-up internet, waiting for pages to load.last but not least, if you are buying it for the 2.0 megapixel camera, you won't be disappointed, the image quality is great, but unfortunately the three second lag applies here too. so unless you're taking pictures of still objects you will be frustrated with what you get.

Home_Kitchen,"we were given this product as a gift and absolutely loved them at first. they are compact (compared to many grinders) and a cute design. unfortunately we found the first flaw a few weeks later when it came time to refill for the first time. the refill doors are tiny! the only reasonable way to pour in salt was to use a paper funnel and the pepper was even worse having to be fed one peppercorn at a time through the tiny door.after the second refill the little doors started refusing to stay shut. since they slide ""up"" to close with the way the mills sit on the shelf. they just fall down and constantly reopen with the help of gravity even when not used.we used these mills at most for 3 meals a week...2 people who aren't heavy spicers, but despite our limited use of these mills the handles broke off in under 11 months.it's a cute product if you are ok with something that is designed to not be used beyond 2-3 refills.

Home_Kitchen,"as other reviewers have stated, these curtain rods will not sustain much weight at all. they really aren't spring rods - you just twist it into place.i ordered 3 and they were so poorly packed that two of them were bent and completely unusable.i wouldn't bother with these, or buy them from country curtains because you can get an anchor so that they can hold more weight and be more stable. of course, their $30 each instead of $19!!!!
"
Home_Kitchen,"i guess i'll start by saying that i don't understand all of the good reviews for this thing. i absolutely hate it. i used to own a vegetable steamer, but my roommate needed it back. it was a very simple design: a pot that sits atop another pot, with a lid that fit either pot, and a cutout in the lid featuring an adjustable hole to control how much steam release you wanted.this steamer does not do that. and furthermore, i don't understand why the steamer needs to sit so low into the bottom pot. it means that you really can't be cooking pasta on the bottom, and steaming the veggies on the top. it sits so low into the bottom pot that the vegetables on the bottom of the steamer essentially end up getting boiled instead of steamed, because they are sitting in water.the black handles also get very hot. it also arrived with one of the handles broken. i have other pots that are this small, and the handles get no where near as hot.overall i think that this is a cheaply made, poorly designed product with no real saving graces. its design is a failure to allow you to both cook food on the bottom, and steam something on the top, because the steamer sits far too low into the bottom pot.i would not recommend this product to anyone, or buy it again.

Cell_Phones_Accessories,"not too much to say about a product like this, but i tried this brand and found them hard to apply and inferior quality. i threw them out and bought the (mroe expensive) palm brand ""anti-glare screen protectors"" and am elated. it was easy to apply and you can clear the fingerprints off of them. the palm ones were more expensive but a much better product - i've had the same one on my treo for 7 months now and don't see why i'd ever need to replace it.

"
Cell_Phones_Accessories,"the fact that i am giving this phone a 2 star seems a bit unreasonable for the phone itself because i haven't really used it yet since i got it from amazon. the phone is to ordered together with cingular service and contract, which was what i did a month ago. the package arrived a week after i first ordered, without sim card which is listed in the invoice. i went through the process of an exchange immediately by printing out the return label and dropping it off at a ups store. a couple of days later, i got the bill from cingular with first month service and activation fee, etc. i called cingular (multiple times) and cancelled the whole service. then when i was emailing amazon to get instruction, i was told that a second package, with the phone only, is sent out and i must go to a cingular store to purchase a sim card and seek refund from amazon. so now, a month after i ordered the phone and service from amazon and a good number of emails back and forth with amazon (who respond to emails more and more slowly), the status is that i have the phone, unusable (no sim card), debating whether or not i should return the whole thing (and wait for 4-6 weeks for them to refund the money to my credit card) or go to a cingular store as they proposed. conclusion: never make complicated order like cell phone and service from amazon because the customer service of amazon through emails only is not customer friendly at all.

"
Cell_Phones_Accessories,"this case appears to be identical to ones sold by wireless emporium and accessoryone. it also appears virtually identical to the widely lauded smart phone experts p6 case, although it is not clear to me whether the original p6 case had the snap-down interior flap behind which two sd cards may be stored.first things first. the case that i have (and thus, most likely all of the very similar cases i mentioned) is definitely not real leather. i am an analytical chemist, so i used reflection ir spectroscopy to determine that the case (including the material wrapping the clip) is actually a polyurethane-based imitation leather. having said that, the case looks nice and i wasn't expecting real leather in this price range anyway. [edit: after three months of daily use the case is now showing significant wear at some of the corners (making it obvious that it is actually imitation leather).]i had several concerns about the functionality of this case, but so far i am very happy with it. here they are:concern 1: the magnetic flap might come open too easily if snagged on something. first, the two magnets are pretty strong. second, the receiving surface is recessed a bit, so the flap doesn't stick out very much. third (and this was a pleasant surprise), the flap springs back closed by itself, especially while it's on your belt--it is actually difficult to force the case to remain in an open position.concern 2: my treo (i have a 700wx) might fall out too easily. the case turns out to be fairly snug, with short elastic strips on the sides. i'm not yet sure, but it looks like the elastic might also have enough give to accomodate egrips. i definitely like having access to my ""naked"" treo. having the treo get knocked out of the case is still a theoretical risk, but i think i am much more likely to simply drop it. it is fairly easy to retrieve the 700 from the case without bumping anything i don't want to, but i'd bet this is not true for the 680 or any other model without a protruding antenna.concern 3: the interior snaps might scratch my treo. the snaps are actually plastic and their faces are quite flat. whether i insert the phone with the screen facing in or out, i have not yet noticed a problem. [edit: after three months of use with the phone facing inward most of this time, there is now indeed a scuff just to the left of the speaker that appears to have come from the snap. despite this, i still prefer to keep the phone facing in.]concern 4: the magnets might cause data loss. (actually, this was never a concern of mine, but i have heard others voice it.) no problem to report. i routinely handle electronics items near much stronger magnetic fields in lab and i have never had a problem. (credit cards are another story, however....)concern 5: the magnets might get pressed into the screen and crack it. the front of the case and the flap actually feel like they have fairly rigid plastic sheets sewn inside, and the magnets themselves are very flat. with the flap closed there are thus several plies of material between the phone and the outside world. no case is bulletproof, but i feel like this one does a more than adequate job of protecting my treo, without adding any new risks due to poor design.concern 6: the clip might come off my belt. not a problem--it's very stiff. so stiff, in fact, that it takes a little practice to easily slide it over your belt. also, it doesn't scratch my belts like clamp-style belt clips did (although we'll see how long the imitation leather covering the clip holds up....)concern 7: i might not like a fixed (non-rotating) clip. the funny thing is that the generic box mine came in has a sticker on it saying ""premium horizontal fitted pouch w/ ratcheting swivel for palm treo 650 700w."" nope--but neither was i expecting one from the product description on this page. it turns out that i wore my prior swivel case in the horizontal position most of the time anyway, and this case sits much closer to my body. it is harder to remove the case completely from my belt (because the clip is so stiff), but this is getting easier with practice.concern 8: poor access to connections. you can easily access the headphone jack whether the screen is facing in or out. either orientation allows access to the volume buttons (after opening the flap) if you want to listen to mp3s. (however, there is no way to conveniently access the 700wx's wmp play/pause button, nor to reassign this function to the side button. the best you can do is reassign it to the ""q"" or ""a"" button, which will be just accessible with the phone in the case, at least with the screen facing out.) however, you cannot charge the phone, connect the synch cable, or access the ringer on/off switch while it is in the case.i hope this helps. this is definitely the best case for my needs, and it was inexpensive to boot! four of five stars.
"
Home_Kitchen,"it's described as ""stainless steel"", but brand new, the bottom had marks that looked like hard water stains. i managed to get them out with vinegar and water, but it has been picking up stains ever since, including fingerprints on the outside, which soap and water won't remove, more hard water stains, and heavy marks at the water line. the pot has always been hand washed and dried.worse, the plastic handles melt and bubble, giving off that nauseating burning plastic smell. as a steamer, one would think it would be designed to withstand high heat. one handle came loose after a few uses. it is easily screwed back on, but i think it's just more evidence of shoddy workmanship.overall this is a very cheap pot in feel and construction. pot is made in china. perhaps there are quality control issues, and i just got a bad one, though i am guessing the handles are the same on all of them.

"
Cell_Phones_Accessories,"when i first received this case i was impressed with how clear it was and how sleek. it did not take any beauty away from the phone itself. however, the clip is way too big and bulky - an inch thick and does not hold well at all. for being so big, one would think it would have to be strong as well, but that is not the case with this clip. the second day i had the case, it cracked in the center where the thin piece of plastic is located between the screen and trackball - and this happened from me putting my pearl in my center console on its side. then, a couple of days later it cracked again and then the middle piece broke off alltogether. the case protected the phone, since the phone did not get damaged or scratched, but the case itself needs a protector to keep it intact. so, the one star is for the good looking nature of this case but not the protection or lack thereof.

Cell_Phones_Accessories,"i was incredibly disappointed when i got a message a few days after i made and paid for my order that said ""we don't have this item in stock. it could take up to two weeks. if after two weeks we don't ship your order, then may can opt to cancel it."" those aren't the exact words, but it was something to that effect. also, i had already paid for priority shipping, which i did not receive and did not get reimbursed for. this was one of the three items on my ticket. the other items were not important and shipped fairly fast. the blackberry battery that i ordered on a priority basis, was critically important, and didn't arrive for about two weeks. while amazon has been good to me over the years, this was a frustrating and disappointing experience.

Cell_Phones_Accessories,"well...two of the main differences between verizon's razrs, and the ones that come fromt-mobile, and cingular are as follows:difference #1:cdma vs. gsmonly the verizon razr runs on their cdma network. the cdma network sucks electricity out of the phone like a vampire!they say: ""200 hours standby"" vs ""400 hours standby"" on a gsm razr.your actual time may vary.my actual battery life was: 20 minutes of use within a 28 hour period of standing by, and the phone was beeping loudly that the battery was completely dead! and no, i did not listen to any music, or watch vcast, or anything like that.difference #2:bluetooth:verizon shuts off the obex portion of the bluetooth that motorola put into the phone when they built it.what that means is: you can not transfer anything to or from the handset via bluetooth. take a picture, or video? pay us to email it to yourself. music? your own ringtones? buy those from us too.one note: i did not get mine from amazon, i got it from verizon directly.verizon's customer service is also very lame. if they ever get my account straightened out, i am going to get my next phone from amazon,and it will be from t-mobile, or cingular.
"
Cell_Phones_Accessories,"i initially purchased this phone through verizon: a brand new razr. it looked nice, but the battery on the phone was worthless. every night i had to recharge the phone. even when i did not use the phone all day, i still had to charge the phone at night. same thing happened after exchanging the battery. i tried three different batteries, but same result. maybe i had a defective phone, but that did not matter to me. i simply exchanged the phone after seven days to another model. i would not get this phone if i were you. hope this helped.

"
Cell_Phones_Accessories,"i have a motto to live by reduce reuse repair recycle. since most americans get a new cellphone every six months to a year, the carrier(it starts with a v} sells you a phone with a battery that will last you two years tops. after two years they stop carrying replacement batteries so they can force you(their loyal customer) to buy another crumby phone that costs the carrier maybe $50 bucks tops so that they can lock you into another contract with a termination fee for the full msrp; lets say 200 dollars. this act of forcing one to buy a new phone every one to two years is fueling a war in central africa where rare metals like coltan and germanium are mined. in 2010 a billion new cellphones will be manufactured with over 200 million of those destined for the usa. if you would like to help end wars for resources buy a replacement battery, keep using that old cellphone, and demand that your carrier give you a discount for preventing bloodshed. i would like to thank this battery manufacture for saving the life of a nameless/faceless child soldier.

Cell_Phones_Accessories,"i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since. it feels poorly constructed, the menus are difficult to navigate, and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them. my biggest complaint is that there appears to be no way to go from high volume to vibrate noiselessly (each push of the volume button makes a beep). i loved that feature on my startac. look elsewhere for a good flip phone.

Home_Kitchen,"these sheets look as pictured. following directions to wash prior to using, the flat sheet shrunk to 72"" wide; it is now twin size. because of the deep pockets in the fitted sheet, it still fits a double bed. they are usable, but barely.also, since the weight is given in metric, ""heavyweight"" is a misnomer.

Cell_Phones_Accessories,"i've used the headset for a little over a year and, although plagued with disconnects when idle, was relatively pleased with the sound quality. not being connected when calls came in was a major annoyance. there was no notice when it disconnected. recently the plastic ear clip broke and i contacted logitech and was informed that,since it was over the one year warranty, my only option would be to purchase a new headset; a huge price to pay for a piece that costs pennies.logitech's concern for its customers appears to be nonexistant.

Home_Kitchen,"purchased this in 2010. doesn't keep coffee warm. well, barely warm -- but significantly cooler than i'd like. my preference is a cup that is almost as warm as when it is first poured -- not crazy hot, but more than lukewarm. this isn't even close. and don't even think that it can warm up a cup that has started to cool because you've been carrying it around for a few minutes.

"
Cell_Phones_Accessories,"first, i hope no one reading these reviews is considering actually paying for this thing. i think that you shouldn't even take it for free, for two reasons: 1. you'll be paying a bundle a month for a service you can barely use, and 2. you probably passed up another free phone that no matter how bad it is, has to be better than the lg 1300.my major complaint is dropped calls. (the battery life is a little thin, but i would say not a major problem.) but it's really tough to have a conversation more involved than ""when are you getting home?"" ""seven."" ""okay, see you then."" because you will spend half your time saying, ""wait, can you say that again?"" the reception is awful (/with/ the new antenna) even when the phone doesn't drop calls. plus, the sound quality is really poor, and as other people have said you have to grind the phone into your ear to make out anything the other person is saying.do not take this as a free phone as i did - anything would be better. if you have the choice between this phone and a cardboard box with numbers written on it, choose the box. at least you can keep photos in it.
"
Cell_Phones_Accessories,"the clip design is big and clunky, and there's a little tab that keeps the phone from rotating that broke after a couple weeks. i'm surprised that quality was this bad coming motorola, i'd recommend looking for an aftermarket clip, it can't be any worse.

Cell_Phones_Accessories,"this unit at first pleased me with adequate audio quality and the ability to bypass those unreliable tape cassette adapters which only work in some cassette players. however, after about 30-40 minutes of playback, this unit fails and displays a flashing ""j"" in the display. if i let it sit for a while, it works again for another 30-40 minutes and then fails again. this failure is both repeatable and seen with a couple of different audio sources. i contacted monster support via their website's email form, but there was no response. i guess most people use it less than 30-40 minutes and therefore do not see this issue.

Home_Kitchen,"we have owed these plates in white for quite some years. maybe six or more. i just replaced all of them with a set from crate and barrell. they are heavy and seemingly well made but they have been faulty in a a number of ways. first my biggest complaint is on the white plates everytime you happen to scrape them with silverware it leaves a permanent mark. never wash anything stainless near them in the diawasher since it will mark it up there as well if it rubs up against them. after years of use they looked horrible with marks all over them. they also seemed to chip very easily. so between the chips and marks all over them i couldn't take looking at them anymore. they also are not good in the microwave. they get very hot and the food not so much. i would not recommend for everyday use. maybe the dark colors would show less marks but if they chip it will be very noticable. my advice is to purchase bone china or porcelain. i will never buy these again.

Cell_Phones_Accessories,"i just got this phone a few days ago to replace my broken sonyericsson z520a. i'm attracted to this samsung because of the thin form factor and pretty impressive spec.but the first time i used it, i was totally disappointed. my biggest complaint is the flat keypad. the keypad doesn't give you enough tactile feedback when you press it. and for some reasons some keys are harder to press than the others. this really annoys me since i text message a lot.other than the keypad, this is a very nice phone. the screen is high resolution (320 x 240) and very bright. imho the user interface is not as intuitive as sony ericsson's.i tried bluetooth on this phone and was able to transfer my phonebook from my laptop without a hitch.but for me, the keypad is the killer. that's the reason i rated it 2 stars. this phone is going back to amazon for sure.

Cell_Phones_Accessories,"i just bought the t610 and have been disapointed so far. the charging circuit in the phone doesn't work properly (never confirms that the battery is fully charged, even after 8+ hours of charging.) but more important, the phone's reception is very poor! i live in the seattle area. once in a brief while, i show all 5 bars on the display, but more often it's only 2 or 3, and a weak 2 or 3 at that. my wife bought the samsung e105 at the same time. the side-by-side comparison is very interesting. her phone shows 5 bars (and gets great reception) most of the time; we're both on t-mobile. i bought the t610 primarily because i wanted bluetooth, but it's not worth it. my recommendation - steer clear of the t610. if you buy it, i think you'll be disappointed too.

"
Cell_Phones_Accessories,"on the surface, this appears to be a good phone, and there's nothing to tip you off about two major flaws in any of the reviews or documentation available.1. you cannot store multiple entries for the same 10-digit phone number; for example, parents who live at the same house but carry different cell phones, or business contacts with the same main number and different extensions. nor is there any provision for dialing an extension automatically after a main number. say you deal with tom in marketing at 111-555-6666 ext 222 and mary in legal at 111-555-6666 ext 333. most phones will allow you to insert a non-numerical character to indicate a pause before dialing the appropriate extension. not so with the t610, which only allows numerical characters. both tom's and mary's numbers would both be stored under mary's entry in the phone book, and you will be, as i am, carrying an additional notepad with all their extensions on it.addendum: thanks to brightcell's contribution, i know how to insert a pause after a main number. :) however, the phone strips off non-numeric characters when importing from a pc address book, and there's nothing about ""pressing and holding 7"" in the t610 manual. neither t-mobile user support nor technical support was aware of this feature. to be completely fair, i tacked on a star to my overall rating.2. if you access your voicemail 20 times a day like i do, expect a lot of unnecessary keystrokes. instead of a simple voicemail indicator flag like most phones, the t610 provides a text message (an e-mail) indicating you have a voicemail. you must read and delete this, then back out to the main menu to access your voicemail. the options menu for the e-mail message includes ""call voicemail""...but this doesn't work owing to some incorrect programming (and i have verified this with t-mobile tech support).addendum: brightcell's contribution not withstanding, t-mobile support confirms that there is no way for a user to turn this ""feature"" off. their tech support rep offered to turn off voicemail notification altogether, which i declined. this, they said, was the only way to make the notification e-mail stop. if pairing with t-mobile service, be aware that they do not know how to make their service work properly with these phones.there are actually a number of other minor issues with this phone, including intermittent bluetooth connectivity, a microphone that picks up every last bit of ambient sound and is almost impossible to use in a car, the fact that the battery wears out quickly even in ""lock"" mode because hitting any key activates the backlight...but all these things i could overlook, were it not for the two major issues above. on the plus side, it is small, cheap and has some kind of bluetooth connectivity.

Home_Kitchen,"these may look like brushed stainless steel but they are not. the magnet that is glued to the back of these is about 3/8&#34; and will not hold anything heavier than a very light potholder. i tried hanging an apron on it and it fell to the bottom of the refrigerator. if you are crafty and can remove this tiny magnet and attach a larger, stronger magnet - these hooks will be useful. otherwise, they are not worth anything. i guess you get what you pay for.

Home_Kitchen,"edit: we are returning this item to amazon for refund. i contacted anchor hocking customer care and received a call back. they wanted me to return to them for analysis in their labs to see why this item made it through their quality control process. unfortunately for all, we needed to go out and purchase a new one locally for a party we were having in 2 days. returning to them would have resulted in them sending out a replacement, leaving us with 2 of these.we ended up purchasing for $10 ($15.00 less than here at amazon) at bed bath and beyond, getting the fluted model. sadly, my wife had to mix and match a base from one box and a top from another to get the least flawed product possible. even then, the best top has a noticeable flaw in the glass, again not physically felt from the outside.i don't know what's wrong with anchor hocking, but honestly for $10.00 and american made, i'm willing to accept the minor flaw in the one we have. or....we will carry it around with us and should we find one that's flawless we will exchange. it's not like we don't pass by a dozen bed, bath, beyonds in our travels.i should mention, it's not a minor ripple as you see in glass. it's an actual flaw in the glass.original post:first, we loved that it was made it america and therefore were willing to pay the current price of $35.00. purchasing sight unseen was a huge mistake for this product so we warn you away.the quality of the glass is quite poor. it's not crystal clear at all, has imperfections throughout and that's not even the reason we returned it.there was a very large ripple in the glass at about a 45 degree angle running down one of the sides. worse, far worse is there was literally a flake of something around 3/8"" across embedded fully in the glass on the cover, very visible. you could not feel it from either side. it's perfectly in the middle of the glass. it was a shard of something.this item should never have made it through whatever inspection process anchor hocking employs. i'm so disappointed in this american company that i intend to contact their headquarters and let them know our experience.we have a party in 2 days and now will be on the search locally for a replacement. i was fearful this would happen. i don't know what technology is used these days in making glass but there is the crystal clear type you see coming out of factories in poland (for example glasses sold at various places in sets) and then there is the imperfect glass you see with imperfections throughout: ripples i call them. this product is definitely made with the latter process. by no means is this glass that perfect pyrex type, or what corning puts out. i'm more disappointed that a made in america product disappointed me so much than the fact that we now must add this to our list of errands to run, including the return of the product to the ups store for drop off.buyer beware. anchor hocking needs a better inspection process with whatever method of glass making they use.

Cell_Phones_Accessories,"there is really nothing very good about this product.first of all, the construction is pretty cheap, which is to be expected for under $20, i guess. it's all plastic and not very well engineered.second, and by far more important, the sound quality is terrible! i've tried every open fm station on my dial, and while i get better sound quality in the lower range (88.1 or so), i would still describe the sound quality as ""something you might expect on an old transistor radio during a thunderstorm"". the bass notes are distorted and buzzy, the treble notes aren't clear, and the vocals sound very screechy most of the time. i've got an xm receiver that i play through the fm radio on the same car stereo, and the sound quality from that is so much better it's not even comparable to what i get from this product, so it's not a problem with the concept in general, or even with my radio. it's this product.honestly, i regret buying this, even for the $15 that i spent, since the sound quality is so bad i can't enjoy the music it plays at all. i'm going to keep my eyes open for another option, but for now i guess i'll just stick to burning my music to cds like the old days... oh, for a digital port in my car stereo...

Home_Kitchen,"i purchased the non-stick set a few years ago. within a year, the nonstick finish was wearing off. i worked a long time on getting this problem taken care of - seems farberware was bought by another company a few years back, and no one wanted to take responsibility (a lifetime guarantee) for my falling-apart cookware. finally, they said they would resurface my pans. i sent them all ($25 in shipping!) in to a company in pennsylvania.......who had them for six months!!!!! they wouldn't return calls, they totally disregarded my plea's for information about my cookware, they didn't care. i had to buy a couple of peices of inexpensive cookware, just so i could put meals on the table. i thought it would possibly take 3 to 4 weeks, but they kept me hanging the whole time. finally, after i waited for those 6 months, my cookware arrived, without my large frying pan. of course, 3 weeks of phone calls back to them, got me no where. i still don't have my pan. that was 2 years ago, and the nonstick surface of the resurfaced pans are wearing off again.my advice would be to never buy nonstick surfaces from farberware. actually, i would never buy any farberware. they may be &quot;classic&quot; but they don't stand behind their products.all-clad.....all the way!!

Cell_Phones_Accessories,"maybe it's just me, but this phone is the worst cell phone that i've ever owned. the reception is poor and constantly cuts off during calls. sometimes turning it on is an ordeal. for example, sometimes when the ""on"" button does not work i have to undo the leather case and open the battery compartment. then i have to remove the battery and put it back in... that is the only way it will work.the sad thing about this phone is that i bought it new from a reputable dealer (at & t wireless); what's even sadder is that i am contracted to keep it for at least a year.the phone looks nice and all and takes decent photos i suppose for a phone, but i already have a digital camera. why do i need one with my phone?i love sony products to death, but when it comes to cell phones, stay away from them!

Cell_Phones_Accessories,"i'm one of those people who don't get caught up in bells and whistles, but am a stickler for good design and practical features.i've had the t610's predicessor, the t68i for over a year now, and by far my biggest problem with that phone is a reception that's poorer than other people's t-mobile phones i'd compared it to. other than this, i had minor gripes with the user interface being slow, weak bluetooth support and other silly design choices. still, it was enough to make me buy it over the others.i decided to get the t610 to see if it addressed any of my issues with the t68i. the user interface is much faster, and the display more pleasing (albeit hard to see in light, a minus). the phone-camera is an absolute joke - very poor quality - but most of these 1st generation phone-cameras are.however, the big problem is (and this boggled my mind), the reception is _consistantly_and_significantly_worse_ than the t68i, when i would compare them side by side in different places around sf. why they would design it this way when the t68i already suffers from poor reception is beyond me. perhaps it was designed for europe initially, where there is much stronger and consistant gsm coverage than in the us. at any rate, it was the deal breaker for me, and i returned the phone and cancelled the contract, which t-mobile did quickly enough, after offering me a few carrots to keep the contract.too bad. if the reception worked well, it would be the best phone out there. selling a lot of these in the us can only hurt t-mobile, as people will only blame the phone's lousy performance on them and move to another carrier. sony ericsson really needs to address this.

(they were not sealed in plastic.) i put in the first battery, turned off my phone, and charged it overnight. the next day i unplugged it and carried the phone around as usual. by night (about 14 hours later), the battery was dead. note that i did not make a single phone call that day. the phone was on standby, and it died in 14 hours! my old battery was almost as good!anyway, i bought two of them, as i said. the second one seems to be holding its charge somewhat, but i can see that the battery life indicator is already down to 75% after 10 hours of zero usage (all on standby).as far as i'm concerned, i was cheated into thinking the following (neither of which are true):1 - i was buying an original blackberry product (note: i have complained about the image to amazon, so i expect they will take action on this soon)2 - i was buying a new batteryi paid about $10 in total for these two batteries, and my time is more valuable than repackaging these and sending them back. my guess is that the seller is counting on exactly this psychology--that most of us will get annoyed for a couple of hours, and then realize that its not worth the time or attention.well done, mr & mrs fake-battery-seller. you got my money, but it's worth the 10 bucks for me to know never to go near you guys again.

Home_Kitchen,"i ordered the mr. coffee warmer because i found myself boiling the kettle in my office several times a day trying to get a hot cup of tea/coffee. well,if it wasn't for the fact that my kettle finally died, i think i would prefer to just keep boiling new cups of tea because the warmer only keeps hot beverages lukewarm at best. it just isn't warm enough to make the beverage enjoyable. i wish it had a thermostat or something so that each person could adjust the heat level best for them. the only word i can use to assess its functionality is, ""ok""; however, i have found another great use for it. now, i'm, not telling anyone else to use it for this purpose because it was not designed to be used this way and we all know that if any injuries are sustained one cannot blame the manufacturer. okay, here goes....ladies, i use it as a heating pad at work when i get cramps. i stick it between the desk and my stomach and voila! no more pain. it's best to use a towel to ensure you don't get burned,but by far, this has been the best use for this product. sorry mr.coffee, but mrs. cramps says she can find a better use for this piece of equipment.

Clothing_Accessories,"first thing you have to know about clothes: there are certain names the are your guarantee of quality (think something like ralph lauren), because these designers impose a certain quality level on the clothes that have their label attached.then there are certain names that mean...nothing. that's because these ""designers"" are simply labels available for license to whatever comes down the pike. bill blass is one of these, at least for cheaper clothes.these shirts represent the very worst of the kinds of clothes that come down that aforementioned pike. slap a bill blass label on them, claim a high list price, and pawn them off on unsuspecting customers via mail order (where you can't see them first, because if you saw them first it wouldn't take you two seconds to realize they stink).these shirts are extremely thin, as has been mentioned before. beyond that, they are not particularly well made. if you care at all about your clothes, you'll regret buying these at any price (including the extremely cheap price at which they are currently available from amazon) and, if you have any self resepct, you'll immediately toss them in that bag you keep for clothes to be donated to the local goodwill store.is it worth even a few dollars to confirm what i'm telling you is true? i say not. why toss your money in the street?

Cell_Phones_Accessories,"good:the unit produces good (maybe even above average) sound for most lay people. pairing with the analog adapter was easy; and, pairing with laptop, desktop, and cell phone were very straightforward.bad:the design of the headset unit is rather small. the (muted silvery) parts of the headset that connect the top part to the ear ""cups"" (speakers) are very cheap. the top (black) part is rather stiff.ugly:if you have a wide or big head, you will need to spread the headset a lot everytime you put it on. when you do that, the muted silvery part will break sooner than later. it will break either around the area where it connects to the top (black) part or the other side where it connects to the ear ""cup"" units.bottom line:if you have small head, this is most likely be a very good bluetooth stereo headsets for you. otherwise, be very careful when putting them on your head and expect them to break.

Cell_Phones_Accessories,"the phone is neat and comes with a lot of great features, but buyer beware-the warranty is basically non-existant. we had a problem with the keyboard and called for warranty service and they said that the warranty is invalid if there is any water damage. we explained that there was no water damage, it just stopped working. they asked us to check a ""dot"" sensor on the phone. if the dot is red, the warranty is invalid. we asked how the dot could be red when the phone (2 months old) never got wet, and their rep told us that rain, sweat or being exposed to humidity or condensation! an unscientific survy of razr uses at a soccer game found 4 of 5 with the dot turned red-and hense no warranty.so bottom line is, it is a good phone, as long as you don't sweat or live in a location where it rains or gets humid.

Cell_Phones_Accessories,"in a nutshell: verizon has made this phone mediocre. if you gotta have a v3m, get one from another carrier.the razr v3m's sharp looks, respectable battery life and fidelity are marred by verizon's sluggish interface and crippled features. if all you want is a thin profiled phone, then you'll probably be happy with this item - and many places offer them up for free. but those searching for a ""media"" rich phone should keep looking.the ""in"" calling feature can save you a bundle if friends and family are verizon subscribers. but...if you are at all interested in customizing the v3m with ringtones, wallpaper and such, be prepared to hand fistfulls of cash to the vcast service or spend oodles of time trolling the net for info on hacks (of which there are plenty - for windows users).the built-in camera is just okay. with the placement of the lens near the hinge you're bound to end up with an index finger in many a shot. the same holds true for the video camera feature - not that you'll use it much since its record time is limited to 15 seconds.you can playback .wma files stored on a transflash card (that's next to the battery that must be removed to access the card) but there's no 3.5mm headphone port; a usb dongle adapter is in box. note: the largest card you can use is a 1gb.no usb cable is included despite the v3m's disabled obex feature (which allows the transferring of files via bluetooth). razrs from sprint, t-mobile, cingular an all-tell have this feature intact!pros:compact sizerespectable sound qualitycan check voicemail from another phonecons:many important wireless functions disabled!

Cell_Phones_Accessories,"this is the second armour case i have bought for a palm pda; prior to this i had used the palm brand had cases. unfortunately, this will probably be the last armour case i purchase, not because of the case but because the palm pda's are no longer being made. having said that, i would get it again in a minute if i had a need: it is easy to open but does not open by itself the way the palm-made hard cases i have used do. it has the right cut-outs in the right places meaning i can plug it into the computer or the power cord while still in the case (unlike the palm-made hard case, where you have to almost remove the unit to access these slots). having two palm pda's stolen in the last year (note to thieves: these are not phones, guys!), i was lucky to still be able to get a palm replacement as well as another one of these cases. but, i doubt i'll be able to get another palm pda if it happens again, which is unfortunate.

Cell_Phones_Accessories,"like the rate plan, like the phone. don't like the way that amazon fulfilled the order, however. evening of day #1: i placed the order. day #2: amazon runs a credit check (as all cellphone vendors do) and i'm approved; so my order status is changed from ""not yet shipped"" to ""shipping soon."" later that day, amazon send me an email to let me know that they've shipped my phones. status changes from ""shipping soon"" to ""shipped."" day #3: amazon send me an email, advising me of my new phone numbers. days #4, #5, #6, #7, #8: still waiting. day #9: phones delivered. ok, so the phones actually arrived during the time period that amazon said they would. so why am i complaining? because on day #3, they had verizon assign phone numbers and activate the phones. so i had the ""privilege"" of paying for phone service on days #3-8 without having the phones in my possession. with a family plan of 4 phones, that was about $18, plus taxes and fees, straight from my pocket to verizon's. gee amazon, thanks for the ""favor"" of activating the phones six days early for me.

Cell_Phones_Accessories,"the soft leather case contains a built in magnet, which when inserting your blackberry phone, powers down the screen, placing the phone in standby mode, without your doing anything other than placing the phone in the holster. flap over the top of the phone also has a magnetic latch, not the strongest in the world; however, the phone will stay put even if standing on your head. case has a swivel clip on the back, allowing adjustment in steps from vertical to horizonal (still secure). only down side is the clip will only fit on belts up to 1-1/4"" width (wider 1-1/2""+ cowboy types or thick holster width belts are too large for the clip), and the plastic can break if stepped on or laid on with enough weight. make sure it is shipped in a box, not a pouch for that reason (it can arrive broken, but someone in shipping does have to work at it, if it's not in a pouch. first one for blackberry several years ago was almost $30,, when you can find a deal on amazon's dealer like unlimited cellular, at less than $10 plus shipping it is a bargain.. dave, construction consultant

Cell_Phones_Accessories,"my experience with the explorer 330 has been mixed. on the positive side, under the best conditions the 330 has worked very well -- incoming and outgoing sound are far more clear than what i have been accustomed to with my blackberry 8830 cell phone.i have found, however, that the 330 performs poorly in several fairly common situations. first, background noise is a real problem. i have several times had callers hear nearby conversations more clearly than my voice, and car engine noise has sometimes drowned out speech. as another reviewer has already noted, the 330 is unusable in windy conditions.second, battery life has been much worse than expected. as the battery level falls, the 330 needs to be closer and closer to the phone; otherwise, the person on the other end of the line will hear an unacceptable level of static, although the bluetooth connection will remain intact. in general, i've found that after about two to four hours of talking time, the cell phone needs to be within an inch or two of the headset to function.third, the 330 has a small effective range from the phone to which it is paired. in general, to have acceptable sound quality, i have had to keep my cell phone in a shirt pocket rather than a pants pocket or on a table in the same room. again, this is closely linked to battery life; the 330's range is better if it is within its first thirty minutes after charging.all in all, this has been an adequate headset, but i have been frustrated by the number of situations in which it cannot be effectively used. in hindsight, i probably would not have made this purchase.

Cell_Phones_Accessories,"initially, this was the best fm transmitter i ever owned. my first one lasted 5 years before it stopped working (though it consumed two aaa batteries every month). the other worked fine, but the signal strength was relatively weak, and so there was a lot of background static. this one worked wonderfully. the audio was as clear as you can get with an fm transmitter, and i never had to worry about static.and then, after 3 months of owning it, the connection between the car plug and the transmitter itself basically stopped functioning. if i wiggled the wire around a bit, the transmitter would power up, but only for a few seconds. the only way i could get it to stay on was by putting constant pressure on the part of the wire that touched the transmitter. even then, it eventually stopped responding even to that. now it does not function at all.if you are willing to take the risk that the transmitter will work properly for as long as you want it, then this is a great product. but if durability is important, you might want to find a different fm transmitter.

Clothing_Accessories,"first thing you have to know about clothes: there are certain names the are your guarantee of quality (think something like ralph lauren), because these designers impose a certain quality level on the clothes that have their label attached.then there are certain names that mean...nothing. that's because these ""designers"" are simply labels available for license to whatever comes down the pike. bill blass is one of these, at least for cheaper clothes.these shirts represent the very worst of the kinds of clothes that come down that aforementioned pike. slap a bill blass label on them, claim a high list price, and pawn them off on unsuspecting customers via mail order (where you can't see them first, because if you saw them first it wouldn't take you two seconds to realize they stink).these shirts are extremely thin, as has been mentioned before. beyond that, they are not particularly well made. if you care at all about your clothes, you'll regret buying these at any price (including the extremely cheap price at which they are currently available from amazon) and, if you have any self resepct, you'll immediately toss them in that bag you keep for clothes to be donated to the local goodwill store.is it worth even a few dollars to confirm what i'm telling you is true? i say not. why toss your money in the street?

Cell_Phones_Accessories,"the biggest downside to this keyboard isn't really the fault of the manufacturer; apple will not allow external keyboards to use auto-capitalize and auto-correction features. beyond that, however, there is only one shift key on the left side of the keyboard, making it impossible to capitalize half of the letters easily. also, the keyboard jiggles a bit when it slides back under the phone. i have tried to begin the process of returning mine, but customer service has not responded to my request nearly one week after i made it. bottom line: if you want a physical keyboard, you probably shouldn't have an iphone in the first place.

Cell_Phones_Accessories,"people who haven't used this phone can't understand why i dislike it so much because it is supposed to be so ""cool"". i bought it because it was one of the only verizon phones that seemed likely to work with my macintosh and isync to transfer contacts over bluetooth. while i had mixed success in that regard there is lots of other things about this phone to not recommend it.as for the physical form; the screen is an absolute blank outdoors in any kind of sunlight, the speaker phone key on the side is easy to accidently activate and i was constantly broadcasting my calls to everybody until i learned to be more careful, the same thing with the voice menu key on the other side, and the center select button on the 4-way navigation key is very difficult to push for anybody with fingers larger than barbie (i had some success using my fingernails until i trimmed them).the user interface is horrible and i wonder if anybody actually tests these things; it can play music and take pictures but still has only one lousy field for the contact name (forget about sorting by last name or trying to keep track of a contact by their company name), all contacts get assigned speed dials and they must be moved, not deleted (very tedious to organize and so i only did it for the first 10 or so speed dials), you don't know for sure what speed dial number you are calling until the call has been initiated (unlike my old phone that would display the contact before making the call; i know they are speed dials but i don't always remember which number i assigned), it takes several key presses to activate ""vibrate only"" (as opposed to one convenient key press on my old phone), get used to the ""get it now menu"" and the ""mobile web"" because most of the navigation keys manage to take you there (there is only one assignable navigation key press and it can't be ""recent calls"", something i used a lot on my old, uncool phone) , backing out of menus is inconsistent (sometimes it is a soft key, sometimes the clear key, sometimes the end key), assignments made for speed dial or custom ringtones don't always seem to stick (for instance, the speed dial number seems to work as assigned but the ""contacts"" listing shows a different speed dial), and the ""itap"" predictive text entry mode is a joke (producing nothing but esperanto for my simple messages). that is enough for now but i could go on.i was able to transfer my contacts to the phone using isync but i did not try anything with the calendar. besides the name limitation mentioned above, only ""mobile"", ""home"" and ""work"" numbers are recognized (in addition to email and fax). a subsequent sync overwrote all my speed dial assignments. given the difficulties with that feature (see above) i don't think i will do that again soon.the voice quality and reception are good but using this phone is frustrating.

Cell_Phones_Accessories,"my husband and i purchased a sony ericsson t610 and a samsung e 105 in july 2004. we had cell phone service from sprint pcs on a family plan and wanted to keep our existing phone numbers. we checked all the instructions on amazon.com and with t-mobile on how to purchase individual phones, switch to a family plan, and port our numbers over. when we got the phones we were successful in porting our numbers over and were very happy with both phones. then we got two bills - one for our phone numbers from sprint pcs, and one from phone numbers we didn't recognize and never heard of. apparently the phone numbers assigned to the phones from amazon.com were never cancelled when we ported the sprint pcs phone numbers over. repeated calls to t-mobile customer service were not helpful - they told us stock answers like disregarding the bill, or that the billing cycle hadn't caught up with the customer service computers, etc. etc. etc. at about the 6th phone call to the company, a customer service rep was able to cancel the account and credit it so we didn't owe them any money for these phantom phone numbers. we were very excited that this was finally resolved and gave this rep's supervisor a glowing report. case closed... or so we thought. we received a final bill for this account that had all sorts of adjustments but still said we owed $41.06. two more phone calls to the company came up with nothing but assurances that this would be taken care of. one rep even scheduled a follow-up call to tell me that it went through, but never actually called. today on the answering machine was the standard recording for code 100 (which means i didn't pay the bill). one more call this evening (october 15, 2004, 3 months after we purchased the phones initially) with me masquerading as superbitch got me assurances that this would be rectified in 2 hours. well, i'm not holding my breath. we like the phones and have no problem with the account that we're supposed to be paying on. it's the account that never should have existed that's the issue. if you're in a situation like we were, make absolutely sure that whatever phantom phone numbers that existed are cancelled as soon as you port your phone numbers over. better yet, use a different phone service.

Cell_Phones_Accessories,"(...)the good: its a very nice looking phone; its the right size, neither too small or too big; blue tooth enabled. the best is the blue tooth that allows you to use wireless headsets or connect to your pc and use the phone to send/receive faxes, surf the net, or update the address book.the bad: you cannot read the screen outside unless its dark (its like trying to watch tv when the sun is hitting the screen directly.); the camera is a gimmick that fades away pretty quick (i never used it that much); the software is slow; and the menus are counter-intuitive.the worst is the software and the menus. i havent seen a phone that has easier menus than nokia and this sony ericsson is no exception. nokia's menus are very intuitive and easy to use, this phone's menu is just badly designed, meaning that you have to push more buttons than necessary to perform common tasks like adding a number to your address book, or editing an address book entry, moving messages around, going back to the main menu, etc. also, because the menus are software-based (vs. being hard wired into the chip like phones with monochrome screens) there is a lag sometimes between the instant you push a button and when the menu is displayed on the screen, like using a computer with little memory. also, you are not allowed to erase the built-in tmobile graphics and sounds, which take up memory space, and you cannot use a recording as your ring tone (they do that so that you dont use ""protected"" music for your ring tones and are thus forced to buy it from them). finally, the phone actually crashes if you stop a voice record command immediately after starting it.all in all, nice looking hardware but with crappily designed menus.

Cell_Phones_Accessories,"this phone is ok, but whatever you do, don't get t-mobile! you can get this phone from at&t.; i have had the worst service from them, and since they have me in a contract for 6 more months, i'm stuck with them. as long as you have a contract with them, if you have a problem, they will basically tell you it's your problem. as soon as the contract runs out they treat you well to get you to sign up again. coverage in the portland oregon area can be poor too. ive had three dropped calls in the past week.be careful, they make their plans look good, but if you sign up with them you will regret it. i sure do.

Clothing_Accessories,"it's definitely not having the cutting as shown on the model. i ordered size m as that's suggested on the the manufacturer's site for size 6. it's way too big. i exchanged it for size s. i have 36"" breast and 26"" waist and it's still way too big.the cutting is very bad as well. it's just a giant piece of flat cloth and they didn't have the shape for cups. thus once you tie up at the back, you will have a weird surplus of fabric underneath your boobs. very ill fitting.

(not sure about other ""hookless"" headset)battery life, full charge, at least 4+ hours continuous talk time (i tested it personally)it weights like nothing to your ear.i had hard time to fit wep200 on my ear, but ax2 is a snuggle fit. for half the price of wep200, i will buy ax2.if you outside of the network and have no reception, the headset will do a ""beep beep"" signal for you, it will keep doing it until your phone get back the reception. some people found it annoying, some people think this is a useful feature.pro: cheap, tight fit, very light weight, best for people who wear glasses.con: okay sound quality, very loud wind noise @ outdoor (on the listener side).one more notice, for people who are going to get it, please read the instruction included carefully before you try to wear it. that plastic sticking out does not goes into your ear canal. it sits within the grove inside of the external ear to secure the ear piece. so don't poke yourself to deaf with that.

Cell_Phones_Accessories,"i paid [a dollar amount over twice what amazon's charging, but that they'll delete if i put it here] for one at [a store the name of which amazon will delete, but if you had a battery club card when you were a kid like i did, you've been there] when they were pretty much the only place to get one. over the years i've tried headsets from at&t;, body glove, hello direct, jabra, and plantronics, and i find the bluespoon's soft spring to be the most secure and most comfortable method of fitting a headset to my ear (for that matter, jabra headsets won't stay in my ear for more than seconds at a time, and plantronics makes the most hideously uncomfortable earpieces on earth).the soft spring does take a bit of getting used to, but that's true of anything that goes in your ear (and also somewhat true of the over-the-ear headsets as well). a good rule of thumb is to wear it for no more than half an hour the first day, and gradually increase the amount of time you wear it each day. it weighs so little that you really don't notice it after you've acclimated to having it in your ear, not just on it.once you've learned how to insert it, the process is quick and one-handed. i don't have any issues with inadvertent button presses (thumb behind the bottom button, middle finger at the tip, and index finger popping the spring into the curve of my ear). and once you've inserted it properly, it's plenty loud. i have to assume that people who say it isn't loud enough just haven't figured out how to insert it.i had trouble with it disconnecting repeatedly from my phone even though it had a full charge, and it turned out that the bluetooth connection in the phone had actually gone bad. the headset connected just fine to my computer, and the computer couldn't maintain a connection to the phone either. once i got the phone replaced that problem went away. so if you have connection problems, test the headset with another phone before you throw it away in disgust. it might just be your phone.i bought a second one from amazon because one of the buttons on my first one didn't survive the impact with the ground after the headset was knocked out of my ear -- i could turn the volume up, but not down. i've repaired that with my trusty soldering iron so now i have two that work. i've also bought one as a gift and recommended it to a friend who's very happy with his.pluses: extreme battery life; light weight; comfort; bluetooth 1.2 and handsfree profile support.minuses: not the highest build quality in the world; replacement springs are nearly impossible to find; if you drop it and the battery is knocked loose, it won't reconnect to your phone until you plug in a power source again; good luck remembering all the button combinations for the handsfree profile.a minus only on paper: no noise reduction. in my experience noise reduction isn't worth the loss of battery power and increase in weight. i'd rather have a lighter headset that goes longer between charges.

Cell_Phones_Accessories,"let me start off by saying that this is my 4th cell phone in 5 years, and this by far is the best phone i've ever owned. phone is so ergonimically correct, and its touch wheel (similiar to that of the ipod) and buttons surrounding the wheel (also touch sensitive) work flawlessly and are amazing. you can set different sensitivity levels for the touch bad and buttons which is awesome. the feature that i enjoy most about this phone is the bluetooth. i purchased a platronics voyager 510 (works flawlessly up to its advertised 30ft range) along with the phone and the two pieces of hardware are a match made in heaven. you can add a multitude of contact information to each phone number saved in your phone (email, fax, home, cell, work, picture, custom ringer -phone call, custom ringer -txt msg, place contacts into a group) and the screen display is top notch as well.some cons, the buttons along the side of the phone are a bit hard to press as they are indented into the phone as to prevent them from being pressed by mistake. would of been nice of lg had put some single, double, triple tick marks on the buttons so that you could at least become familiar with the feel and function of the button. the latch for the charger and for the usb hookup seem a bit flimsy and i believe will ultimately break prematurely.last thing, i didn't know that vcast only worked in certain areas. if you're not in verizons ed-vo area of coverage then you cannot use the feature. i'm in santa barbara and i get no coverage, checked for other local cities...ventura, santa maria, thousand oaks and they are not covered either. however, pasadena and los angeles are covered...not sure if that helps anyone but thought i'd through it out their.

Cell_Phones_Accessories,"strengths:this headset connects quickly to the phone, is easy to use, and reception is clear. i had a bt200 before this one. other than the color difference, i asked what is so different? upon making my first call with the headset, i immmediately noticed how the transfer of the call from my p900 to the bt250 was almost instantaneous. the reception and clarity of the headset is clear and the connection time is quick. the adjustment time for the user to get used to this device is minimal. just remember to answer your call by hitting the headset power button quickly. the headset has plenty of charge time to last throughout the day.weaknesses:one weakness is that you should not use it outside when wind is present. however, this fault is not due to the headset itself. another weakeness is that the holder of the bt250 needs improvement. i kept the device in my pocket without losing it. within two days of starting to use the holder with the belt clip, i almost lost the bt250. fortunately, i was able to trace my steps to locate it outside my car. use great caution and be aware of your bt250 if you use the holder on your belt. if you sit down, the holder can easily can easily push the bt250 loose from the holder.summary:with this headset, you can say goodbye to wires forever. once you have a truly wireless headset, you will not want to go back to wires. the bt250 quickly connects to the phone, is clear and static free, and is relatively simple to use. other than the holder of this bt250, you will enjoy this headset.

Clothing_Accessories,"i think this is a case of my expectations being too high. i was so encouraged by the great reviews of this product, i really was expecting a miracle. after only wearing this twice, it is stretched out. at first, i thought perhaps it would regain it's shape after a few hours but nope! it's no better than a cheap, fashion corset. it will smooth things out so there's less bulging under the clothes but i was looking for a real ""waist trainer"", something that would go on tight and stay tight. considering i found this product when i searched specifically for ""waist trainer"", i would say the claims of this product are misleading. it is shapewear, it is not a ""cincher"" or a ""trainer"".

Home_Kitchen,"i ordered these sheets hoping for that comfy flannel sheet i remembered from the old days. snuggling under the covers in the fall and winter, cosseted by soft sheets. perhaps, i was too optimistic, given the price.these sheets seem to be fairly good quality, but they don't have that fuzzy softness of flannel. there's really not much nap. they are made of a low thread count sort of jersey fabric. the patterns are good, and they come packaged nicely, but in an era where high thread count sheets are available affordably, these sheets are a disappointment.if you like jersey-type sheets, and you aren't too concerned about the softness right out of the package or the thread count, these could be just right for you. and you can't beat the price.

Cell_Phones_Accessories,"this is the worst phone i have ever owned...and i've had many. sure, it's cute and light, but the phone is constantly dropping calls, gets terrible reception, decides not to ring when it feels like it and the battery life is about 36 hours with no talking and about 24 hours if you talk for about 1-2 hours (in battery save mode). i certainly would not recommend this phone to anyone. i had a motorola before this which was absolutely wonderful, even after i dropped it in my dog's water dish! i thought this phone would be equally as great, but i'm very disappointed!! with my old phone i had perfect reception everywhere in my apartment, now i have to stand by the window and most times this phone won't ring in the apartment at all.the things that i do like over my old phone is the option to have true tones and it takes better pictures. not worth it though! think twice before buying this phone!

Cell_Phones_Accessories,"i bought this fm transmitter about 6 months ago and was fairly satisfied. it was a little more expensive than i thought it should be for the basic features it has, but i decided to give it a chance. the sound quality wasn't excellent but was well above what you would get from a cheap device, and the signal strength was really good. from what i've written one would think it would be a 4 star device, and it would be have been had it not shorted out 6 months after i bought it.i take care of my electronics so i know it wasn't excessive force or abuse that did it in. now whenever i try to use it if the move the cable even the slightest bit the left speaker cuts out, very frustrating.

Home_Kitchen,"this pillow is incredibly helpful for people who have difficulty getting comfortable in bed because it affords a variety of positions to relieve painful areas. but getting in bed can require some simple gymnastic maneuvers because the pillow is so thick and cumbersome. and getting out of bed also requires some special moves, especially if you have a high mattress. overall, not a simple process for a good nights sleep. the head area also compresses after a few nights of use and rearranging the filling is bothersome. because it's a considerable investment, i end up using it only occasionally.

"
Cell_Phones_Accessories,"i really tried to do my research before i purchased this phone, but unfortunately most of the available reviews were short term users. i was already expecting below-average battery life and a sub par camera, but the benefits i was expecting outweighed these concerns for me. the major problems began to creep in with more use.there are several good points to the phone. it really is a good-looking and well-built phone, and it just ""feels right."" the sound quality is excellent for both calls and music (assuming you have a stereo headset), and even the bluetooth headset sound quality is head and shoulders above my old motorola. the audio player is aac/m4a capable. the resolution of both lcds is great. nokia pc suite can sync the phone's calendar with lotus notes, a rare feature. i appreciate the release button more than i thought i would. i'm sure i'll miss that if my next phone doesn't have it. the only problem with the release button is sometimes accidentally pushing it as you pull out the phone while receiving a call. if the phone is set to automatically answer when it opens, the release gets pushed accidentally, and it's a call you don't want to take at the moment, you're stuck holding the phone closed until it stops ringing. still a nice feature.moving on to the phone's problems: one might assume that the combination of bluetooth and stereo mp3 playback on a phone would imply that the a2dp (stereo) bluetooth profile is supported. apparently, one would be wrong. admittedly, i probably should have assumed no specific mention of a2dp implied that the phone does not support it, but it doesn't help that searching the internet yields mixed results on the issue, and even nokia tech support still can't tell me one way or the other. as i can't get it to work with an a2dp gateway, it's probably safe to assume at this point that it doesn't support the profile.the rest of the problems stem from the outdated series 40 operating system and the phone's music functionality. the music player has been tacked on as an afterthought, which has severely overextended the capabilities of the os. first, the music controls are very cumbersome, using a cursor system to activate on-screen buttons rather than using the phone's keypad for controls. track numbers may be entered manually in the main player view but not in the playlist view.the phone has apparently not been tested with ""large"" music libraries. i purchased a 2gb microsd card soon after the phone, ready to load it up with music. however, the music transfer application included with nokia pc suite develops problems when trying to read a library of anything over 2000 songs or so. the main issue is that the database of meta tags breaks around that point. nokia tech support informed me that their test libraries are all around 1000 files or under. however, i'm sure i'm not alone in having a library of around 10,000 tracks or more these days. fortunately, you can load music files manually through either data transfer mode on the phone, or directly to the card.the problems don't end with the pc software, though. the phone does not organize tracks by subfolders; all tracks within the main music folder and all its subfolders are loaded into one huge playlist. for more specific selection, you either have to use the clumsy folder navigation interface and constantly reselect the main music folder, or you must manually create playlists with the music transfer software, which is time consuming and problematic with the issues i mentioned above. i plan to experiment with generic m3u playlists, but i don't have high hopes. and it gets worse: after filling up my 2gb card and manually creating a playlist for every album, which was 77 in total, attempting to change playlists now completely crashes the phone. it restarts and then reloads the entire library. for now, i'm navigating the huge playlist by guessing at track numbers, although you can only enter three digits. it's almost humorous what happens after track 999: the phone increments the first 9 to 10, so you see track 10 000 (except the last digit is partially cut off). at track 1100, you see 10 100 in the list.it has begun to feel like i'm beta testing the software in this phone, even though i paid for it and signed my life away for another two years to get it. it has crashed more than ten times in the three months i've had it. i especially felt like a beta tester when nokia tech support had me carry out experiments with my large music library and report back. i'm still hoping for a major firmware update, but i'm not holding my breath. frankly, they just don't seem that interested in working out the kinks in this mid-market phone with its outdated software components.i'd still recommend this phone if you don't have a large music collection and only want to use the music player very occasionally. if you won't use the music player at all, please buy a cheaper phone that doesn't have it. if you have a large collection and plan to use it regularly, as in my situation, i'd highly recommend spending a little more for something with at least the series 60 os, if you buy a nokia.

Cell_Phones_Accessories,"well, it technically does what it is supposed to do--that is, allows you to transfer files from your phone to your computer or vice versa. but, it is rude & puts up a fight to do so. the thing came with no instructions, so it took forever to install. once installed, it creates a desktop icon which can't be removed or modified...because it's not actually a desktop icon (when i figure out what exactly this thing is, i'll post it) or in the registry at all. actual transfer of files takes over the entire computer (don't have anything else running) and is slower than a floppy drive! i've found a ton of settings and such that the software changed without asking (rude in my book), so i'm probably going to have to re-install windows to get everything back the way i like it. although, it's nice to have the pics off my phone to email and have a custom wallpaper & ringtones on my phone, i'm really thinking of returning this rude little punk. if i could, i'd give it zero stars.(i'm not 100% sure that this will make a difference since the main problem appears to be sony's software that you download from them, but the cable appears to be made by someone other than sony and the oficial sony data cable is pretty much only sold through sony's website.)update on 6/4/2006:i was given a data cable for my sony ericsson z500a as a gift (turned out to be a 3rd party cable like this product is). at first, i was happy that i'd be able to transfer pictures taken with my camera phone to my computer to email to friends back home...but after installing everything, the thing only worked a few times at a nerve-rackingly slow pace. after tons of headaches messing with that, i contacted sony's tech support. they don't seem to know how to figure out problems very well, and about all they could do on that call was get my info to send out a new cable. the new cable (sony ericsson cable) doesn't seem to work either, and i've called them several times now--each time speaking with 2-3 reps.so, my advice would be to not bother with the data cable (third party or sony's) since neither will work properly. if you have a third party cable such as this product, don't tell sony tech support because then they won't help you, so you're basically just out the money you spent on a cheap unofficial cable. just enjoy your sony ericsson z500a & watch anyone who has a camera phone that has a working data cable for ideas for your next phone.

Clothing_Accessories,"dockers are dockers, so that's not the problem. just be sure you don't trust the images if you choose to buy these via amazon. ""cafe,"" for example, should be ""coffee."" despite the fact that the image for ""cafe"" shows a stone or very light gray color, ""cafe"" is actually dark brown. so the product isn't defective, but is misleading: i didn't want brown pants, but that's what i got.

Clothing_Accessories,"i bought 6 of these shirts going by the photographs and some of the reviews. dont mean to be rude, but people who gave these shirts probably haven't wore a decent dress shirt. you can frequently get 'good' $45 shirt for $10 in malls when on sale. i thought this was a better deal. but boy oh boy, i can assure you this is not much better than what you might get at a dollar store. i had ordered these as a gift, but now will give them to red cross because these should not be worn at any kind of formal occassion, or even for daily use (except maybe when you are working at septic tanks or something). these are from bangladesh, and i can assure you, they are not much better than what would be sold for $0.50 in bgd. if you have any self-respect and work in anything but a lowest income group atmosphere, do not buy these shirts.

Cell_Phones_Accessories,"i bought two of these at christmas time. the idea is great and thought they would be good in the cars. the first problem was that none of the tips would fit my motorola c261 phone. then i tried it on a nokia 2600. although there was a tip that fit perfectly, when i tried to charge the phone the phone screen said stop and had a little stop sign on it. so i assume the volts were not correct. the flash lite has two setting and worked great. returned the items as did not work for me.

Cell_Phones_Accessories,"this phone seemed soooooo awesome out of the box! it looks bodacious! it feels like high quality. you turn it on and its easy to use, sounds good, and has a great speakerphone.but here are a couple problems i had with the phone...poor reception! about 3 or 4 times in the first 2 weeks of owning this phone, my reception would cut out for hours at a time no matter where i was in town.alarm problems!!! i set an alarm for everyday when i wake up. well i switched shifts so i disable the alarm on the phone... but it still wouldn't shut off!!! every day it went off at the same time no matter how many times i deleted the alarm! and if the phone is locked it's very hard to shut the alarm off before you want to throw the phone against the wall.... also it would activate the alarm about 50 times in the same moment, causing the device to freeze and no way to reset it, unless you take the battery out. which can be very frustrating when you're trying to sleep in.i have read in online posts that this has happens to lots of s710 owners.everything else is great! good wi-fi, calls, etc.

Cell_Phones_Accessories,"this phone is a huge step down from the cheap old lg phone i got for free with my account ~3 years ago. definitely avoid this phone entirely, or make sure that you get the updated software from a verizon store asap.pros:- semi-slim profilecons:- 'slim' profile accomplished at expense of making phone wider another way- glossy screen has massive glare and always appears dirty- menu navigation requires many more button presses and extraneous submenues than my older phone for no apparent benefit- annoying alerts for missed calls, messages, etc... will continue until you physically open the phone and respond to them- software was only finalized about a month ago and requires that it be updated while physically connected to a verizon store's computer- phones have tendency toward battery and charger problems unless software is updated, as listed above- poor reception and sound quality

Home_Kitchen,"if you thought that farberware made good quality cookware, you are wrong. they used to. but now they've cut corners and are creating such low quality cookware that it's actually a safety issue. and just try to contact customer support, feedback, or even try and find the president of the company! you'll find ""shell corportations""/licensing companies and tons of complaints on various state departments of consumer affairs websites.i tried contacting them to report a serious problem with the new cookware that i've added to my collection (a 9 3/4"" fry pan & a 6 3/4"" sauce pot). on both the part where the handle connects to the metal cookware is now manufactured half as deep as their older products. the screw holding them together loosens up with just a single use. you'll need to keep a phillips head screwdriver at the ready to tighten the handle each time you use the pot!!! without putting too fine a point on it, please note that the pot -by definition- usually contains scalding hot liquids, so you sure don't want an extremely wobbly handle while you're using the cookware!!i tried to contact farberware to report this, and to see if they had a ""work around"" in place, like maybe longer screws! farberware's own website is so obstructive, and impossible to use that it can only be a deliberate attempt to disavow product warranties and to wall themselves off from actual customer feedback. you find yourself in a loop that does not allow input. and there is no other way on their site to contact them except by clicking on the ""contact us"" which only sends you annoying emails back with non-functional links! doing d&b; research i found that the current holder of the farberware license is meyer corporation u.s. and their president's name, so i'm going to follow up with post mail.but i first wanted to warn you! i've always found amazon's product reviews to be extremely helpful and have positively guided a lot of my own buying decisions. unfortunately, i had not checked product reviews before buying the two new pots because of my prior good experience with the quality of farberware products. so live and learn. i've also learned that true high quality alternatives to farberware are creuset, lodge, and the dutch oven from the mario battlia line. avoid farberware like the plague! -alana

Home_Kitchen,"so i love coffee. i drink it all the time. morning, noon, night i can never get enough. with a habit like this it doesn't take long for people you know and love to start calling you things like ""mr. cup of joe' or ""coffee head"". the list goes on and on, and some are cute ...others not so much. i never really thought that i would need a coffee warmer, as i stated before i drink it all the time so it never gets cold. well last year around the holidays my office decided to have a party. some genius came up with the idea to have a secret santa event. for those who don't know what that means, you basically draw a name out of a hat and then buy a present for that person. i wasn't big on the idea; i don't really care for most people in my office. they are either too young, too dumb, or both to not get on my nerves. i can be a bit irritable at times as a side effect for my caffeine addiction. anyway, i lucked out and i drew the name of this young intern we have in the office. what a knock out. every guy we had working wanted her, lucky for me she wanted nothing to do with them, and i ended up making her my mistress. so drawing her name for the secret santa was pretty much like winning the lottery. i was trying to figure out how i could buy her a present without my wife getting wise to the affair. so this was like killing two birds with one stone. what i didn't realize was that the whole thing was rigged and she set it up for me to draw her name, and surprise, she drew mine. so i start racking by brain trying to figure out what i am going to get this dame for a present. i was stuck between a sleek nightgown, and a pair of leather chaps that came with a free ball gag (if you don't know what that is, watch the movie pulp fiction, they put one in the colored fella's mouth before they have their way with him). i ended up going with the night gown. like i originally suspected, my wife was suspicious of the present when i handed it to her and told her to wrap it up. once i told her it was for the office intern she looked like she wanted to say something else, but i quickly shut her down.so the night of the party we are all sitting around a circle exchanging gifts. at this point i had quite a bit to drink; next to coffee my favorite drink is jim beam. i wasn't in the mood for any smart aleck remarks. well it gets to be the interns turn to open her gift. everyone is taken back immediately when she pulled out the nighty. it was as if they all knew our dirty little secret. i could see it in all of their eyes, and i was just waiting for one of them to have the nerve to say something so i could strike them right in their face. fran (she is the 65 year old office secretary) started to say something under her breath. i couldn't tell exactly what she was saying but, it sounded like ""oh my lord, i guess we know what that means....inaudible....blah blah...etc."" i jumped up to my feet in about two shakes of a lambs tail. fran wasn't so big and bad when i was an inch away screaming in her face to try and say or do something. she backed down, they always do. well, there were a few minutes of awkward silence that was only broken by the occasional whimper from fran. finally we started again with the festivities. in a few minutes it was my turn to open up my present. well, after i had spent a pretty penny on the nighty, this lady goes out and gets me this mr. coffee mug warmer. i felt enraged! who did she think she was? i immediately stood up and told her that we were done. i never wanted to see her again, and i told her so. so again with water works and drama. at that point it didn't matter so i got up and went to my office. i have a fully stocked bar in the corner of my office and a couple fingers of single malt sounded pretty good at the time. i also have a projector screen and about seventy five full feature adult movies. the good stuff, like midgets that beat the holy heck out of one another with bamboo canes...stuff like that. it was the perfect place to collect my thoughts. that is probably why i didn't pay too much attention to what was going on outside.as i had stated before, my wife was starting to suspect that something may have been going on between me and the intern. what i didn't know, was that she had been spying on me for quite some time. can you imagine that? where is the trust and love in a marriage if it comes down to this? she should have been ashamed of herself but she had recently taken some women's right class in night school and was feeling all self ritechous. you know what i mean, that whole ""i am woman hear me roar"" bull spit. she was thinking about how she was going to make her move and i guess the best she could come up with was throwing a cup of hot coffee in my face. i don't know if she was going for some sort of ironic twist, or was just too dumb to think of anything better (i lean toward the latter of the two). so i am sitting there watching these two dwarfs going at it, while i sipped my scotch. i was finally starting to relax and feel the merry holiday spirit when i heard the office door squeak behind me. i started to turn around to see who it was. my brain was just barely able to recognize the figure in the doorway as my wife when all of the sudden this dark wall of black liquid hits me in the face. i have to admit, i wasn't ready for that. i sat there stunned for a moment or two and then my senses started coming back to me. the smell was what tipped me off to the fact that the liquid that was just thrown at my face was coffee. then i started to think about why i wasn't in severe pain from being assaulted with a hot beverage. i had heard a story about a guy who took mcdonalds to court after burning himself with their coffee. this stuff didn't even hurt a little. i pushed the thought out of my mind when i took chase after my wife. several hours later while i had her sitting in her timeout bench that i had built in the closet, i asked her why she threw cold coffee at me and not hot. between her sobs she explained that she had actually put the cup of coffee on the mug warmer for a good half hour and thought that it was piping hot. to her disappointment the contraption is a piece of junk and couldn't even get the drink to a hot temperature. after she apologized a few times i decided to let her out of her timeout hole. i was tired after the events and a foot massage was sounding pretty good. as she rubbed my feet a question crept into my mind. i asked her if she had plugged the thing in before she tried to heat up the coffee and she said she had forgotten. well, i married her for her father's money and mothers' looks; i guess a brain was too much to ask for. she finished the foot massage and i told her that if she went to go pick up the intern i might be able to forgive her before the new year. so, i guess in the end i can't really tell you if this thing works or not. i can only say for sure that it won't work if it is not plugged in! i can't believe we passed the 18th amendment giving them the chance to vote!

Cell_Phones_Accessories,"i liked this case when i first got it. it fit the phone perfectly, did not add any extra bulk and provided some protection. quickly ran into problems. it presses on something b/c the phone lost all function to the keyboard and camera section of the phone. i could still use the top section hence the phone still worked. it required a reboot and that seemed to correct the problem but it required it up to 5 times in one day. another office mate ran into the same problem. i would send it back but lost the receipt now it sits in a basket of other worthless junk.

Clothing_Accessories,"my husband doesn't like to wear shirts under his dress shirts; however, he will have to with these. i ordered 2 whites and 1 tan. they are nice looking but very, very thin. the retail tags say $45. i'd be quite upset if i had paid that much! i guess for $9.99, they'll be okay. i didn't save a lot though cause now i have to buy some new t-shirts to wear underneath! if you don't have a white-collar job, these would be fine (at a reasonable price) for occassional wear. however, my husband has to wear them everyday, and i doubt they will hold up well since they are so thin.

Home_Kitchen,"we bought this coffeemaker to replace a melitta. this unit is much taller, barely fits under the cabinets in our kitchen. the carafe is a strange design, have to turn it almost upside down to get all the liquid out. the device that forces water through the filter is narrow, so when i tried to use my re-usable filter, most of the coffee did not even get wet and made a poor pot of coffee; you have to use a paper filter. the dripper drips every time you take the pot off, even though it has a stopper device, which splashes and makes a mess. the mess is more evident because the coffeemaker is white. the coffee it makes is marginal, seems to take more coffee to make it ordinary strength. i would not recommend this coffeemaker.

Home_Kitchen,"when i received this item, i plugged it in and smoke immediately began to pour out of the base. i left it for a moment or two, thinking that it may have just been a build up of dust or plastic residue (or whatever) burning off on the first use.after 30 - 40 seconds, the smoke was billowing out even more heavily and i detected a increasing burning smell.at that point i unplugged the thing rather than leaving it to (possibly) burst into flames!so, for me, this item was a total waste of money - and not worth the postal costs of returning it.

Cell_Phones_Accessories,"ever since i first switched to the iphone my biggest complaint was the lack of a physical keyboard. when i got the iphone 5 i thought it was the time to finally take the plunge. i saw there were a few option but i was hesitant on some the cheaper priced items because i wanted something with high quality. i rather pay more up front and not have to worry about issues in the long run. so i passed on the $30 options and found the ""premium"" $100 option. the boxwave keyboard buddy. bluetooth keyboard, backlight keys, 2 week batter life, slim aluminum profile... it was exactly what i wanted. looking at pictures of it online my mouth watered.ready to take the plunge i was dissapointed it didnt come out for another month. (10/27) finally the end of october came and it was delayed to my disappointment. (11/16) that thursday (11/15) i placed my preorder. the weekend went by and the product page still showed a preorder status (shipping 11/16) despite the fact it was the 18th! finally that wednesday i get a notification my order shipped that monday (11/19). checking my shipping status was also a dissapointment because it rarely updated. after much confusion with ups and the post office my order was delivered on the 28th. must have came from china i thought, despite the fact that it claims my order started in washington. opening it up the packaging was cheap but who cares! the case felt as good as it looked! i let if fully charge before i used to so i wouldnt have to worry about it for the rest of the week. i enjoyed that case for a whole day and thought it was the cat's pajamas.soon to my disappointment i found it started having pairing issues after one day. i couldnt get it to sync for long periods of time. and it only got worst. now it only syncs long enough for me to send one message before i have to re pair it. i cant tell if it the fact that the battery is dying but that couldnt be true, could it? they claim 2 weeks of moderate battery use so in my mind thats 8-10 days real world use.... but its dead after 4 days? sounds like a company you could trust! so today i started exploring the website to find out about how to get mine swapped, maybe its just a bad one. while searching i find ""boxwave's warranty policy."" how long does boxwave guarantee their products to work? 2 years like a good company should? nope. 1 year like most companies now a days do? nope. 100 days! 3.5 months.... do you know how short that is? that is the same warranty comapnies offer on refurbished products! so boxwave believes there $100 case is as good quality as a product that breaks and is then ""fixed"" and sold at a lower cost. its as good of quality as a used car sold by a used car dealer. a brand new premium product with the guarantee of a lower quality warranty. scary. even if i did swap mine out, i started having problems day 2, what happens on day 101?(3 months 11 days, not that far away) i go buy another $100 case? or do i reminisce of day one where everything was perfect and ignore the $100 other days of hell?stay away people. this is a $10 cases components wrapped in a $50 case shell sold for $100 and backed by a 100% satisfaction guaranteed refurbished warranty.for those who dont want to read and just skim to the bottom i will save you time:crap, crap, crap, crap, crap crap, crap, crap, crap, crap crap, crap, crap, crap, crap crap, crap, crap, crap, crap crap, crap, crap, crap, crap crap, crap, crap, crap, crap.

Cell_Phones_Accessories,"it's a very convient head-set that works very well, when it works. i agree with some of the posts that the design is not robust. it falls apart within a month of use. i've had to replace mine several times now. the wire that connects to the microphone is poorly designed so that if you put enough strain on it, which is not much, you will start having static, noice, and complete cut-off of sound issues. if you choose to buy this product, buy several as a back up if you can affort it or just buy other aftermarket products that are cheaper.

Clothing_Accessories,"i purchased an under armour compression tee at a local store in a size large. the shirt fit fantastic. i wanted a back up so i purchased this one online size large, different color. the shirt arrives on time, open the package and it is a large but does not even fit over my shoulders.... i contacted the vendor for an exchange. they do not do exchanges but will allow me to return the shirt. if the shirt was worn it has to be washed before returning it... no problem for i could not get the shirt on anyway so tags etc were all in place. if you pass 30 days, there is a restocking fee of 20% which i was unaware of.when i questioned the vendor why i have a large and ordered the same size it did not fit. the vendor stated that under armour has different sizing charts for different shirts. that just did not make sense. how are you to buy a product with ""floating"" sizes.so, i went online to nordstrum to find the same exact heat guard compression tee. there was a size chart that could be pulled up to check size before ordering.... only 1 chart for under armour. i did all the measurements correctly to find that i was to order a large.i know the shirt fits tight but since i already had a large that fits, and the chart from under armor at nordstrum confirmed that i had ordered the correct shirt size, the statement that there are different size charts for different under armour shirts "" just doesn't fit!"".i personally will visit a store and actually try it on to avoid the hassle and disappointment of waiting for a product that does not fit, seemingly was ordered correctly, and then had to be mailed back.

Cell_Phones_Accessories,"probably the worst part of this phone is the texting. not only do i not like the style of the sms program, but the texting is so slow on this phone that i'll have a full sentence typed but it will still be one the first couple words. then you have to wait until it catches up to you and see if you've made a mistake. this gets really annoying if you're writing more than two word messages.the lag in texting applies to everything else. this is by far the slowest phone i have ever owned.the one positive thing i will say about this phone is that i like the option of having a normal ringtone (one that actually sounds like a phone); that, however, is a feature of all motorola phones.as far as the 2mp camera, do not buy this phone for the camera, as you will be disappointed. the quality is horrible. i thought that a 2mp camera would take better pictures than the 1.3 that i had on my previous phone. i was sadly mistaken. pictures from this phone look good neither on the phone or on a computer.if i could afford it, i would trash this phone and just buy a new one, but i'll have to wait until i can renew my contract and go back to nokia.

Cell_Phones_Accessories,"i've been a palm fanatic for over 10 years. i've always been an early adopter and bought the latest gadget when it first came out. i agree with many of these reviewers that the treo 600 was a breakthrough product and has great functionality, etc. but it is completely unreliable. i'm currently on my 3rd 600. each one died a hideous death after about 6 months. first the normal phone speaker died. so handspring replaced it for free. six months later the monster buzzing in my ear made using the phone impossible (in addition it had a nasty problem of doing a hard reset all on its own about once a week - often when i was traveling.) so again handspring replaced it. about 4 months into my 3rd device the monster screeching buzzing returned. this time when i called for a new one i was informed by palm that, ""we don't replace phones for free any more. it will cost you $200 to get a replacement."" so basically palm's business model is: we sell you a product that consistenly doesn't work and then we demand that you pay us as much to replace it (with another one that doesn't work) as you would have to spend to get a blackberry. it's unbelieveable. so i thought i'd suck it up and buy the 650 (even though two different friends bought it and both had already swapped it out for the same unreliability). but palm told me to get a 650 would cost me $700 ! i said, ""wait a minute, handspring used to give me the new phone each time at a discount if i'd send my old one back."" but i was informed that palm doesn't reward loyalty in any way anymore. what a joke.so i wrote a letter to the ceo of palm to complain. that was 5 months ago. no response or acknowledgement. what a disappointing company - in every aspect of it.i now use a motorola razor. palm is a joke. no serious business person can rely on the palm products or the company any more. shame.

Cell_Phones_Accessories,"the v600 model was originally designed for at&t. due to the at&t/cingular merger, cingular decided to take this model as well. however, cingular could not get the phone to fully work on their 850mhz network. that is why they started replacing the phones of their v600 customers for v400 models. all this corrective process (call it recall, if you wish) is carried out by cingular exclusively. as per the phone itself, the v600 is not being recalled or discontinued by motorola but is being recalled and discontinued by cingular. it is just cingular's network that is not capable of supporting this model. an easy way to test this is to try and activate this phone through at&t: it will experience no difficulties whatsoever. motorola will repair the phone, if necessary, and return it to you fully functional. however, if you wish to receive a replacement unit, you will need to contact cingular. a new motorola model is currently in development to replace the v600. the new model will be very similar to the v600 model.

Cell_Phones_Accessories,"i was very disappointed with the earglove. it looked so cool with the interchangeable foam covers and all, but i just couldn't get it to work for me. the build quality left a lot to be desired, and after several attempts to fit it comfortably, it sort of came apart, although i managed to get it together again. then i just couldn't get the earbud thing to fit in my ear; if i stuck it right in it was very painful, as it's not padded, and if i positioned it hovering outside my earhole, i could hardly hear a thing, especially when the car was moving. i had much better luck with a competitor earpiece which looped right around my ear, and had a broader speaker cover which sat outside my earhole and gave plenty of volume. another irritating thing about the earglove was the mute button, which if your phone is not compatible cuts off the call instead.i don't want to be too harsh since i think with these ear-thingies its just a case of finding one which fits the shape and size of your ear best. maybe the earglove would work well for you. its just a shame you have to buy one to find out. maybe a friend has one you could try for size first, because if it doesn't fit it will be useless.

Home_Kitchen,"first off, i love the coffee this machine makes, and the thermal carafe is great--no burnt coffee taste you get with the burner plate models. that said, i've gone thru two of these coffee makers in 17 months and won't get another. with the first, after 6 months the pre-brew function timer stopped working. i didn't use it much, so decided to live without that. but 4 months later it stopped brewing entirely--it would ""beep"" it was done, but no coffee had brewed :-( it was replaced--i had option of going with another brand/model but i stayed with this one, b/c, as said, i love the coffee and the thermal carafe. now replacement, after 4 months, stopped working. but this time i was there when it went bad--was brewing a second pot of coffee and smoke started pouring out the top of the machine. it smelled like an electric fire. i turned it off, unplugged, and poured cold water in the back, just in case that would help. after that, it is dead--i tried turning it on again to see what would happen (we really wanted coffee), but it just ""beeped"" that it was done, with no brewing. i don't know what burnt up, but i won't risk an electric fire with another one. i'll miss the great coffee & the thermal carafe, so hope cuisinart figures out the problem and fixes it for future models. a coffee pot at this price should last a few years at least.

Cell_Phones_Accessories,"i had such faith in this phone when i first bought it. now that i am 7 treo phones later and it only being a year and a half....i have to say that this is the worst high end purchase i have ever gotten. in the beginning all of the reviews were wonderful from consumer reports and gadget blogs and electronic magazine reviews. however none of these publications seems to have let consumers know the truth about the horrible quality of these phones. as a pda they function fairly well but as a phone...the signal is always dropping (that is if there is a signal). friends and family claim it is hard to hear what i was saying when using the phone and that it sounded like i was in a tunnel. hearing what other people were saying was difficult. i would have to go outside to try to get a better signal just to hear what was being said. i purchased my phone through amazon to use with sprint. i invested in the monthly warranty to replace the phone. this seemed like a good plan until i realized that they were replacing my phone with refurbished phones that had the same problems as the handset that i had just given them. when my final sixth phone was replaced by sprint i made a call to a friend from the parking lot to ensure that it worked before i left the store (i had learned by this point). five minutes later yelling into the phone and trying to call back 3 times with no success (and no...the mute was not on). realizing that i had yet another dud on my hands i went back into the sprint store to take out the poor 16 year old clerk that had the misfortune of replacing my handset five minutes prior. apparently he had a panicked look on his face since he was waiting on customers who had just decided to get...you got it, a treo 600. well he quickly summoned his manager who decided to give me a brand-new never been opened treo 650 free. so yes i did get an upgrade free for all of my trouble. it is not much better than the treo 600. the signal is weak and it is hard to hear on both ends and when on vibrate mode the calls get sent straight to voicemail. convenient for emergencies i would say. i live in arizona but i sure do wish that i lived in california since there is currently a class-action suit against palm-one and the various cell phone carriers of the treo 600 and 650 for the poor quality of the product and replacing handsets with equally poor treos. at this point since the treo 700 just was released, it probably is not on the class action suit. however the treo 700 does run on a windows operating system which will make your palm os software from your treo 600/650 obsolete. it will also make it morevulnerable to viruses and lets not forget that little trick of being able to erase a bluetooth devices address book when someone has bluetooth enabled, also there is the ability to tap into peoples' conversations that they are having with their wireless blue-tooth headset. (not that i do it but i'm sure that some people are actually enjoying rush hour much more due to this security flaw). overall i would say that palm-one as a company has gone downhill in terms of quailty and customer service and that both the treo 600 and 650 are phones that i would not waste your time or money on.

"
Home_Kitchen,"i bought this product in may 2011 from another vendor (sleep warehouse) based on a lower price. so i can't comment on best beds as a merchant. but what i have to say about the sensus 5 pound/3"" deep queen-sized mattress topper is worth considering, regardless of where you might buy it.1. i bought the sensus to help with ""pressure points"" discomfort from side-sleeping on a very good, firm mattress. to my surprise, the foam topper, while helpful, did not eliminate the pressure point problem. i naively assumed that putting a soft layer on top of a firm mattress would improve my sleeping experience, but unfortunately it did not completely address pain in shoulders/hips from side sleeping.2. the product caused other problems i did not anticipate. within a few days of starting to use the sensus, i began having aches in my lower and middle back. before using sensus, i had never experienced routine lower and mid back problems from my sleeping arrangements. as you consider whether to buy sensus, think about whether it could actually cause pain in parts of your body that are not problematic right now. for me this was the deal breaker.3. i think sensus caused my lower/mid back problems because it is too soft. this is ironic, since many reviews rave about 5 pound density being the best and firmest choice. but it really isn't firm, which is kind of the point because the big selling point is that it will alleviate pressure point problems. 5 pound density may be ""firm"" relative to cheaper, lower density foam, but it is not truly ""firm"".so you've got this foam layer which is soft, but not ""too"" soft -- it is firm enough that you can still have pressure point issues, while being soft enough to cause lower and middle back pain. everyone is different, but if you buy sensus you're gambling that its softness level will relieve pressure points while not causing other back problems. don't assume you will achieve this optimal result.perhaps if i'd bought a 2 inch thickness the softness of the foam would have blended optimally with the firmness of my mattress to alleviate pressure point issues while not creating lower/mid-back problems. but i'll never know....4. the sensus is very fragile and very unwieldy. it is extremely easy to damage it, especially in the unpacking process. you have to pry apart the foam -- it sticks pretty tightly to itself and the prying apart process is time consuming and quite tricky.the fragility of sensus is ideal for merchants because if you want to return the product (as i do) any damage will prevent you from persuading the merchant to take it back. the 5 pound density, 3"" deep topper weighs about 50 pounds in queen size, so getting it out of the package, unpeeling it into a flat rectangle, coaxing it into a fabric encasement and then getting it atop your bed is quite a job. and then if you decide to return it, the whole process has to be gone through in reverse... and you can only return it if all of this labor proceeds with no damage taking place with the topper.i assure you that it is virtually impossible to unpack, unfold, encase, install, de-install, de-encase, re-fold and re-pack this topper without some damage occurring. therefore it is very unlikely you'll be able to return this sensus product, so do think very carefully before buying it. despite my best efforts, mine has several divots on the edges and some dirt in one spot where the packaging opened up en route to my house, so it is probably a total loss. with the cover that's $409 down the drain. i might try cragislist, or i might just send it off to a charity. or i might just chop it into little bits and landfill it. not sure yet what i'll do with this thing now that i'm done with it in just 3 weeks...5. sensus has an odor. many people write about odors emanating from various mattress toppers, and the stories are quite true. i aired my sensus out on the floor for 4 days before installing it, and even now some 3 weeks later it is still smelly. the odor is more musty than chemical -- think mildewed linens smell more than new shower curtain smell. i am unsure whether the mildewy smell is because of how the topper was warehoused before shipment or is inherent to this type of foam... for me it is not a huge issue, but for those who really dislike odors in their sleeping products it needs to be considered.6. when you see photos of a hand print in ""memory"" foam with the hand hovering over the print it has just etched in the foam, do not take those photos at face value. the photos imply the ""memory"" foam has a pronounced tendency to hold whatever form is pressed into it for an extended time period. but no....i tested this sensus topper -- stuck my hand deep in the foam, held it there for 30 seconds with consistent pressure, and then quickly withdrew my hand. it takes less than 4 seconds for any trace of my hand imprint to vanish. the photos imply something much longer, and it just ain't so. with standard high density foam you get no ""memory"" and with this expensive stuff you get a 3.5 second ""memory"". standard foam costs far, far less than this stuff, so is it worth hundreds of dollars for 3.5 seconds of ""memory""?
