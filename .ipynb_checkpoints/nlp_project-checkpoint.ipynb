      "this case is not worth the money. the first problem was with the screw that hold the belt clip would not stay in the case. i glued that in place. then the clip would not hold onto the case. then the belt clip broke. the last thing was that slide that holds the palm in the case broke. i would not recommend this case to anyone and would like to warn anyone that might want to try it. look elsewhere!!!\n",

      " i purchased the pulsar 590a 2 months ago. it is a terrific product. the sound is great. i purchased it to simultaneously connect to my ipod and blackberry pearl phone while walking. again, i could not be more satisfied.in addition, plantronics support is amazing. i asked them for the cost to just replace the adapter. i thought i broke it. they said it should be almost impossible to break with normal use. i got another pulsar 590a headset and adapter without cost to me in less than a week.the unit is small and folds into a nice looking case. the light is no big deal. very nice looking headphones. i do not understand anyone negatively reviewing this product.\n",

      "let me start off by saying that this is my 4th cell phone in 5 years, and this by far is the best phone i've ever owned. phone is so ergonimically correct, and its touch wheel (similiar to that of the ipod) and buttons surrounding the wheel (also touch sensitive) work flawlessly and are amazing. you can set different sensitivity levels for the touch bad and buttons which is awesome. the feature that i enjoy most about this phone is the bluetooth. i purchased a platronics voyager 510 (works flawlessly up to its advertised 30ft range) along with the phone and the two pieces of hardware are a match made in heaven. you can add a multitude of contact information to each phone number saved in your phone (email, fax, home, cell, work, picture, custom ringer -phone call, custom ringer -txt msg, place contacts into a group) and the screen display is top notch as well.some cons, the buttons along the side of the phone are a bit hard to press as they are indented into the phone as to prevent them from being pressed by mistake. would of been nice of lg had put some single, double, triple tick marks on the buttons so that you could at least become familiar with the feel and function of the button. the latch for the charger and for the usb hookup seem a bit flimsy and i believe will ultimately break prematurely.last thing, i didn't know that vcast only worked in certain areas. if you're not in verizons ed-vo area of coverage then you cannot use the feature. i'm in santa barbara and i get no coverage, checked for other local cities...ventura, santa maria, thousand oaks and they are not covered either. however, pasadena and los angeles are covered...not sure if that helps anyone but thought i'd through it out their.\n",

      "it's cheap, eforcity delivers quickly, however, may not actually be oem. all of the oem chargers i've seen (model number syn0847) has glowing stylized \"m\" motorola logo. this item, however, does not; it only has a small blue led underneath the \"m\" that glows when it's plugged in. all of the other labeling on the charger looks authentic motorola. maybe a really good knockoff? anyway, does the job just fine (see title), and, again, it beats paying $20 at cingular.\n",

      "some quick commentsfirst dont get the verizon car charger. mine had a tag on the cord which indicated that it must be disconnected after the phone is charged. maybe to prevent battery overcharging? useless for me on long trips! verizon charger was over $30.00. at staples a motorola charge which can be left connected was less than $16.00.i use a palm pilot alot and can dial via bluetooth phone numbers on other cell phones. this does not work on v3m. also simple sending of contact information did not work. a quick look for software to connect v3m to outlook or the palm for daily schedules resulted in nothing. to connect the v3m to pc via usb appears to require a $30.00 package from verizon.the v3m does not have a standard wired hands free connector on the phone. i did get a \"converter\" which i have not tested but even if it does the phone does not support both the charger and wired hands free at the same time. the converter may only be for headphones but even if it works with headphones it another thing to carry around or lose.voice dialing does work great and speaker phone is good.\n",

      "these work to charge your phone, but the casing around part that plugs into the phone is slightly wide, causing the plug to fall out of the phone easily. this is especially aggravating with the car charger. i think it's worth the money to get the better fitting items from samsung.also - why does samsung change the plug in each phone model? the blackjack 1 and blackjack 2 do not use interchangeable plugs and my wife's samsung flipphone uses a completely different connection. are they trying to make money on peripherals and chargers?\n",

      "i initially purchased this phone through verizon: a brand new razr. it looked nice, but the battery on the phone was worthless. every night i had to recharge the phone. even when i did not use the phone all day, i still had to charge the phone at night. same thing happened after exchanging the battery. i tried three different batteries, but same result. maybe i had a defective phone, but that did not matter to me. i simply exchanged the phone after seven days to another model. i would not get this phone if i were you. hope this helped.\n",
